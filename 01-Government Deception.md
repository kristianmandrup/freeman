# The Great deceptions

See [video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5CRWOP70fQ&list=PL2D15233CA000272E)

The World is the TRUTH. Life exists on Earth (Flat plane under the Dome).
Life exists where it can be supported on the Earth and NOT where it can't.
Why is this important?
Can life forms exist without FULL support from the Earth.
What would happen if any aspect of this full support did not exist?

Obvious needs:
- light, heat, water, minerals from the ground, food, shelter
- ability to pro-create (make offspring)

Homeopathy - plants provide cure for any ailment

The Earth provides everything

If ANYTHING necessary to support a life forms does not exist within the BASIC resources
provided by the Earth, then that life form cannot exist on Earth.

Anything NOT provided by the basic resources on Earth are NOT essential to life.

- money, legalese, religion, politics, ... (all the same thing)

These concepts are all deceptions and all depend on misplaced faiths
They are mind prisons, prisons without bars. The Matrix.

Those most hopelessly enslaved are those who falsely believe they are free.

What is politics?

Faith placed in something or someone, such as your government or government official.
Is this faith reasonable or mis-placed?

What is a religion?

Faith placed in something or someone, such as vicar, priest or the "Almighty".
Is this faith reasonable or mis-placed?

If one person has a delusion it's called insanity. If hundreds or thousands have a delusion it's a cult.
If millions have the same delusion it's called a religion.

What is legalese?

Faith placed in something or someone, such as parliament, congress to create statutes (statutary laws).
Is this faith reasonable or mis-placed?

The meanings are not the same as in ordinary language or speech.

Person in legalese. Any group of people can for legal purposes be called a person.
Corporations, companies are all different kinds of persons. An artificial person.

A person is a legal entity, a merchant vessel. A person is not a living entity.
A person is a corpse, a dead entity that can NOT act.
A person doesn't have a mind or a brain. A person can't be jailed.
A person can't pick up a pen and sign. You can NOT sign a contract without a brain.
Therefore a person can NOT legally sign a contract.

Many common words have been subveerted and have a different meaning in legalese.

Understand - means do you Stand Under the legalese (the statutary law).

Is this legal system and government a success or failure for the people?
Most people would say no.

What is Money?

It is NOT what we use to buy things. Buy, sell, commerce etc. equate to money so that is a circular definition.

Money is credit. What is credit?

Faith placed in something. Is this faith reasonable or mis-placed?

Why do we need these misplaced faiths?

Planet Earth does not provide them from its BASIC resources
No other lifeforms recognize them and survives happily without them
Are we missing something? What do you think?
Should we send money, legalese, religion and politics into the dustbin of history?
Or is it better to eat our own tails chasing fiat (fake) money endlessly?

Money vs Freedom

If you want money you can't have freedom. If you want freedom you can't have money.
If you want both we have what we have now. Money is ANY monetary system.

You can never afford what you yourself made.
Your Employer says what you did was worth X amount and pays you that amount.
What you did is worth X. After tax T you only receive X-T.
So you will never physically receive enough credits to buy what you yourself made.
Note: worth, buy, money etc are all imaginations.

Legal vs Lawful

Are you law abiding or legal abiding? Do you know the difference?
There are THREE things we call law:

- Laws of Nature

Law of Nature - are lawful

* Mankind does NOT make them. Mankind observes them and their effects, then enumerates and evaluates them.
Utilise and apply them.
* They apply universally and unilaterally without fear or favor. No courts are required.
* There is no penalty for breaking them because they cannot be broken

Common Law - Law of the Land (lawful)

* Mankind DOES make the laws, based entirely on common sense. The laws are universal and unchangeable.
What you know to be right, fair, honourable and just
* They are applied by Courts called Courts de Jure (Courts of Justice). A fair application is by a Jury of 12.
* There is always a penalty for breaking them because they can be broken if one is prepared to face and accept the consequences

The law of the land is the law of land dwellers, so they can live in peace with other land dwellers

In June of 1215, the Magna Carta was signed. Refers to Law of the Land and Law of the Realm.
There was NO parliament and NO statutes.

The Legislated Rules of Society (Statutes - legal)

* Mankind DOES make these rules. Mankind changes them in accordance with his own desires. Mankind can wipe them away.
* The rules are applied by courts, called Court de Facto (Court of Arbitration, or Tribunal)
* They are not applied equally because always depend on judgement. One law for the rich, one law for the poor.
* There is always a penalty for breaking them because they can be broken if one is prepared to accept the consequences.

Legal is exactly the OPPOSITE of lawful, ie. UN-lawful.
It follows that a law abiding citizen is also a legal abiding citizen. 
When statutes make things illegal, it has no consequence, since legislated laws only apply 
to agents of the state and are unlawful to anyone else (Humans - in Common Law).

Legal operates entirely on paperwork, on "names" (Legal Fiction "persons")
Lawful operates naturally (Natural Law) on Humans (Common Law).

That lawful and legal are the same is a deception.

You are NOT your name. Everything written to you is to your name. All you need to do, fundamentally is to write back: "I am not that name".

People who administer the law should know the law and abide by the law.

Common Law - We see the reality and we write down Common sense rules that fit the reality
Parliament write statutes and then say that creates reality - but reality doesn't work that way

A Deed Poll can detach one "name" and associate a different "name", but the Human remains exactly the same.
In a Common Law Court (Court de Jure) a Witness will be asked 
to indicate someone, irrespective of that Human's "name" (ie. Identity Parade)

The Deception is: To make you believe that YOU are YOUR NAME... when you are NOT!
Your name is nothing more than a fiction.

You are [first name] of the [family name] family "as commonly called".
Your human name is used only to get your attention, no more than that.

Rough justice HONOURABLE adjucation take place between these two parties, 
when you A Human Being have EVERYTHING to lose and they have VIRTUALLY NOTHING to lose?
The playing field is stacked vertically against you
Sacrifice is the meausure of credibility. What have they got to sacrifice? What is their credibility?
So called justice? It's Absurd!

The very fact that your DNA can be taken PROVES that you are NOT a legal fiction, so when the policeman takes it
thank them for proving YOUR point by forensic evidence. "My DNA was taken, therefore I, the Human, CANNOT be their "Named Defendant".
It proves you are the "flesh and blood".

What IS the Common Law?

No DELIBERATE harm to anyone else and as much precaution (as is reasonable) to prevent 
ACCIDENTAL harm from your actions

No DELIBERATE loss to anyone else and as much precaution (as is reasonable) to 
prevent ACCIDENTAL loss from your actions

No DELIBERATE breach of another's peace and as much precaution (as is reasonable) to 
prevent ACCIDENTAL breaches from your actions

No DELIBERATE deviousness or mischief of your PROMISES, AGREEMENTS and ARRANGEMENTS and 
as much precaution (as is reasonable) to prevent ACCIDENTAL occurences

Fundamentally: To ACT RESPONSIBLY TOWARDS ALL OTHERS and to be prepared to TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL YOUR ACTIONS

In other words: Plain COMMON SENSE

How is the Common Law made?

By the verdicts of 12, after hearing evidence from both sides, based on FIRST HAND knowledge and using their
Common Sense to try to put themselves in that situation and to decide what they themselves would do in those
circumstances. 

By UNREBUTTED STATEMENTS OF TRUTH (Affidavits), based on FIRST HAND knowledge and signed under penalty of perjury.
There is no other way, because FIRST HAND evidence is the only acceptable evidence while 
"All are equal under the Law"

It therefore takes Twelve Humans to LAWFULLY overpower One Human.

THE BOTTOM LINE: - ALWAYS - UNLESS THE WARRANT OR ORDER STEMS FROM THE ABOVE IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND VOID IN LAW.

To accuse someone of wrong doing, you write down statements of truth describing the situation and wrong doing (Affidavit) 
then give the accused 30 days to rebute the statements. When you write the Affidavit it puts you in the exact same
position as a witness (perjury - lying is criminal)

If they have rebutted your statements by telling lies, you have a leon on them.
There is only ONE TRUTH in any given situation.

How do you know if you are abiding within common law?

You ask yourself: "Would a Jury of 12, appraised of all the facts, agree with me or not?"

In other words: "Do I feel that my actions are HONOURABLE?"

The hierarchy on the Earth plane:

- 1) The Earth plane itself, including the resources it provides to support all life forms
- 2) NON-SENTIENT life, plants etc. which support all life forms
- 3) SENTIENT life, which consists of:
  - 3a) Humans
  - 3b) All other Animals
  - 3c) Other REAL living entitities such as bacteria, fungi etc.

4) Fictional entities
- Government (ie. "The Crown")
- Requires us Humans to RECOGNISE it. If no-one recognised "The Crown" it would NOT exist.

Faiths placed or misplaced?

The EU is just another fiction. If you believe in it, it exists, if not it doesn't.

5) Sub-fictional and "role playing" entities
- CORPORATIONS
- Judges, Magistrates, Lawyers, Solicitors, Politicians, Policymen (Police), Bailifs

Which requires "The Crown" to recognise them (via "legals" ie. statutes)
But don't forget, "The Crown" requires Human recognition in the first place.

The Magna Carta (Law of the Land) talks about:
- forresters, justiciors, barons and earls, lords, constables, monarch, sheriffs and Bailifs (sheriff underling)
- The Sheriff keeps the peace in the Shire
- Sheriffs, Bailifss and Constables are peace keepers. Their job is to keep the peace.

Missing from the Magna Carta, therefore missing from the Law of the Land:
- Judges, Magistrates, Lawyers, Solicitors, Politicians, Policymen

Law does not require any of the fictions.

The lowest of the low:

6) Members of Staff (of CORPORATIONS) which require the CORPORATION to recognise them, which 
requires The Crown to recognise them, which requires Humans to recognise The Crown
Just how low can you get? :)
So when you get some arrogant letter from a Member of Staff from a CORPORATION, what is your appropriate response?

EVERYTHING is CORPORATIONS, INCLUDING members of Parliament, The Ministry of Justice, and the Police Forces
So all the fictions at 5 actually reside in 6 in the hierarchy.
They are ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS and as a member of the Public, you are their MASTER. They are there to do what YOU
tell them, not the other way around. Otherwise the tail wags the dog.

As a Human Being, you are SOVEREIGN

Queen Elisabeth the II is a CORPORATION, The United Kingdom Plc is a CORPORATION.
F.ex Devon and Cornwall Police are OWNED by IBM. The police has as much authority as a security guard at Tesco.
The Police are just a COMPANY. But the Police don't realise how LOW they are and how LITTLE authority they've
actually got.

When a Policeman stops you and asks, "What's your name?" - he is Raping you (mind rape)

If they Police arrest and mistreat you without due cause, it is a tresspass of your SOVEREIGN Authority

What is a Society?

"A group of like-minded people who come together to deliberate, determine and act towards a common goal"

Q: How do you know if they are like-minded?
A: By inspecting the published common goals

Q: What IS a group of like-minded people?
A: A Membership. A Society of Members, WHO JOIN - OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL - after inspecting 
the published common goals and deciding that they agree with them

Q: What happens if after a period of time a Member decides that direction the Society has taken 
is not what he or she agrees with?
A: They can resign their Membership of the own free will (without recriminations)

Only of your own free will can you join a society and NO ONE has the right to join you.

State agent: "What is your name?" (in the implied society)
Sovereign: "I haven't got one" (as Human outside society)
State agent: "What do you mean, everyone has got one" (in the implied society)
Sovereign: "I sure don't" (I don't identify as member of implied society)
State agent: "I will give you a name"
Sovereign: "You have no right to assign me a name against my will"

State agent: "Are you Mr Smith?"
Sovereign: "No, I'm not"
State agent: "I think you are"
Sovereign: "Are you my Mother or are you God? What right do you have to assume my name"

What is a Statute?

"The legislated rule of a Society" - ie. the legals, deliberated, determined and acted upon (Acts)
by the Legislative Body of the Society (Parliament, Congress, ...)
Members consent to these rules by JOINING
Non-Members are unaffected
Your Doctor does NOT need to obey the Legislated Rules (Statutes) of the Law Society
Your Solicitor does NOT need to obey the Hippocratic Oath and Legislated Rules of the Medical Association
Did you CONSENT to become a Member of the Society whose Legislated Rules your Parliament acts? When was that?
Parliamentary statutes are nothing more than Company Policy (The Ministry of Justice Corporation)
hence the term "policymen" to refer to the enforcers of it... on NON-MEMBERS

I am not a member of that society or corporation for which you are enforcing policies. 
I have never willingly joined any such society or corporation. I NEVER CONSENTED to join.

A 10 pound note:

It reads: "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 10 pounds"
Have you ever SEEN "the sum of 10 pounds"?  or have you only seen notes PROMISING "the sum of 10 pounds"?
It is a PROMISORY note an IOU (I Owe You)
Just think of how many "sums of 10 pounds" the Bank of England has promised to pay, which it NEVER actually PAYS.
It is promising the "pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" - something that doesn't even really exist - pure fiction.
Do we need it? It might as well have said, I will pay the bearer 10 unicorns :)
In the past it might have been a certain weight of silver or gold. But what are these really?
Just a lump of metal. Useful, but so is paper or any material. Money doesn't exist.
It's an Illusion.

First Quarterly Bulletin from Bank of England, 2008

"banks extend credit by simply increasing the borrowing customer's current account, which can be paid
away to whichever the borrower want by the bank simply 'writing a cheque on itself'".
That is, banks extend credit by creating money.
Translation: "Money is created out of thin air" (by means of a Human Signature)

How can you be a borrower if all they are doing to extend credit is by creating money. 
If they already had the money, you could borrow it. But they are saying they just create it for you.

For the bailouts, all the banks really did was to write a few more cheques on themselves to create money.

If you don't pay a demand, a Court de Facto will consider you to be depriving whoever makes the demand

- We have already seen that money, legalese, politics etc. are just "faith placed in something"
- Can you deprive someone of their beliefs?
- How can you deprive someone of their "money" belief?

The bank believes you owe them money... but it's not real

The Signature (Mark) made by a Human Being

- Starts the Money out of thin air process
- Along with a Date and an Amount creates an IOU/Promisory note
- Financial Institutions will take this note and will "monetise" it, by typing numbers into a computer database
- The Title (Mortgage) Deed (Signed by Human) PLUS Mortgage Acceptance pages comprise a Promisory Note - WHICH - MUST - Pay in FULL for the property 
 right at the start of the purchasing via a mortgage process

When you are signing for something, you are saying, I'm prepared to be an energy unit to "work my socks off".

Mortgages are one of the biggest SCAMS of all time:

A Title (Mortgage) Deed is YOUR authorisation to hand possesion of something you FULLY OWN to some other entity (Financial Institution) 
The Land Registry will accept this authorisation and will lodge the Charge against the property
CAN YOU AUTHORISE POSSESION TO SOMEONE ELSE OF SOMETHING YOU DO NOT YOURSELF OWN!?
DO NOT OWN OUTRIGHT?
NO is the Answer! You can only do what you like with YOUR OWN PROPERTY - OWNED OUTRIGHT!!
You NEVER have the RIGHT to do this with SOMENE ELSE'S property (if you are a joint-holder, 
you have to get agreement from the other joint-holders)

A charging order secures a debt you have with a creditor against your property. 
When the debt is cleared the charging order will be paid off from the proceeds.

Secured debt is debt backed or secured by collateral to reduce the risk associated with lending, 
such as a mortgage. If the borrower defaults on repayment, the bank seizes the house, 
sells it and uses the proceeds to pay back the debt. 
Assets backing debt or a debt instrument are considered security, 
which is why unsecured debt is considered a riskier investment than secured debt.

Nothing will happen until you sign the Title (Mortgage) Deed
BUT YOU ARE TOLD NOT TO DATE IT
Thus it is BOT a VALID Promisory note when you send it back
But they have your signature on the Deed and filling out the date is easy in order to 
create a Promisory note. So all they have to do is to "monetise" the Promisory note - 
WHICH PAYS FOR THE PROPERTY IN FULL - and means that YOU ARE THE SOLE OWNER, WITH FULL TITLE and the
date can be added to the Deed (by them). This can then be sent to the Land Registry, 
who will apply the charge in favour of the Financial Institution (and they have you by the neck)
But - if you HAVE FULL TITLE and you have PAID IN FULL (via your Promisory note) and you must have done that
in order to gain full title, since no-one has the right to authorise a charge on something 
they do NOT own), then why do you need to make REPAYMENTS and why is there ANY 
need for the Charge? There is NO NEED for either. It's a SCAM!
What would be "fair" would be to pay the Financial Institution a reasonable fee (a couple of hundred)
for the facility of "monetising" your Promisory note, and that should be that.

[diagram of Mortgage scam]

[diagram of Mortgage "fix"]

For any so called "debt":
You can make it a bit fancy (with a Spirograph graphic around the edges for example)

Write the Amount in words and numbers
For the Date you can say: "On the date that a sum, paid by the Bank of England 
to the bearer on demand, is shown to have taken place in real terms"
Get it notarised (costs ~40-50 pounds) by signing it in front of a Notary Public
The Notary confirms legally that it was you and only YOU who signed it. 
You will need to show ID, even though all IDs state not to be used for identification purposes!

Send the Promisory note to whoever is making the demand, pointing out in cover letter, that:
- The Statutary Definition of a Promisory Note is "Cash" (it has to be in order to make bank notes)
- The Bills of Exchange Act 1882 says that "if payment is tendered, but is rejected, then that debt no longer exists"

Tender - An offer of money; the act by which one individual offers someone who is holding a claim or demand against him or her the amount of money that the offeror regards and admits is due, in order to satisfy the claim or demand, in the absence of any contingency or stipulation attached to the offer.

Can we get away with it? That's not the point! People outside the Freedom Movement (and many inside as well) think
we are trying to get away with something. We are NOT. We are trying to prevent THEM from 
getting away with blakcmail & extortions & frauds & deceptions. Writing a Promisory note brings the deception
of IOUs to the forefront. ("legal tender" vs "lawful tender")
The objective is to become FREE not to "get rich".
Remember: Money is an Illusion.

[diagram of Promisory Note actors and exchange]

The Bank of England Promisory note is promising "a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow" and so does your Promisory note.
They are no different.

The Government can charter the Bank of England to create money. The Government creates bonds.
They offer the bonds to the Bank who put money in the account of the Government or makes loans to the Government
which have to be paid by interest. Tax payers will then have to repay the "debt" with interest

[diagram of Government - Central Bank money creation scheme]

Why can the government not simply create the money itelf? Then it wouldn't have to borrow it
Abraham Lincoln created debt free greenbacks - and was assasinated
JF Kennedy had made executive orders to create government money - and was assasinated
Andrew Jackson - shut down Second Bank of the United States - several attempts were made to assasinate him 

Jackson vetoed the renewal of the charter of the Second Bank of the U.S

"Many of our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress."

If you did not have to pay taxes you would be free to do what you like. To not have to go to work to "earn a living".
You can stay at home, go to the beach, paint etc.

It is designed this way (taxes, fees etc) to keep you under control.

The Court system

Full of problems, because people do not know the roles that Judges and Magistrates have sworn to 
play via their SOLEMNY-SWORN Oaths of Office 

Added to this, the fact that Grand Juries were abolished in 1931
Plus the role allocated to the Crown Prosecution Service
The "system" is FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED and irretrivable broken - such that tinkering
with it only makes things worse (as far as true, honourable - real unbiased - justice is concerned)

For any consent other than common law, your consent is needed, for it to apply to you.
