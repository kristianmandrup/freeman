# The Nature of the Cage

See [The Nature of the Cage - John Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZRp-8b9dDU)

## The name

If you see the title Mr or Mrs or they write your name in uppercase, like: "DOE, JOHN" or "JOHN DOE", this dates back to Admiralty Law.
Legal fiction and Strawman is an abstract term.

People assume debt collectors have actual power. They have NO power, whatsoever. They ONLY haver the power you give to them.

Once you comprehend the difference between Lawful and Legal, what your legal fiction and strawman is, the
fear of debt collectors, police and authority goes away.

## Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the quality of having supreme independent authority over your own flesh and blood, Human body or territory.

If you live in the UK, you are lead to believe, that the Queen is the only sovereign. This is completely false.

We the people gave the Queen her Sovereignty, through the Coronation Oath, and as you all know, you cannot give what you don't have yourself.
That means each and everyone of us is Sovereign.

We have forgotten we are powerful.

The GOVERNMENT need to feed us constant FEAR propaganda through the controlled FAKE NEWS media, 
in order that we BEG for their PROTECTION and willingly GIVE AWAY ever more of our FREEDOMS and 
RIGHTS until NONE are left, and we are left DESTITUTE and DEPENDENT, like a CHILD completely 
dependent on tyrannical, ABUSIVE PARENTS.

Government is a creation of Man and can never be above man. They always need your consent and this is where your power lies.
With knowledge always comes power. The power to take a stand against any government or corporation. The power to say NO!

It is said that you need to know that you're in a cage before you can escape from that cage.
Let's look into how you're being tricked and how your power is being taken away from you.

## Strawman

You are being conned into:

- Paying Tax
- Getting a Drivers License
- Registering your car
- Paying Fines
- Attending Court
- and much more

All are optional and need your consent. All statutes and acts are optional too. 

Your strawman is a finctional legal entity, created at your birth, through a Birth Certificate and the Registration of that birth.

You can liken this to a game of Monopoly. In the game you have a token, a piece on the board. You move it around the board.
This board piece is your name in uppercase and a title.

When someone is born, two entities are created. One is the Human Being in flesh and blood, the other is a legal fiction, that is just a piece of paper, 
the Birth Certificate. We are duped into believing they are one and the same. We are tricked into representing the legal fiction, the strawman.
When you get a fine, it is actually consulting the legal fiction, the corporate entity.

When you are interacting with any corporate entity, they are not interacting with you but your legal fiction.
They simply can't deal with a flesh and blood human. They can only deal with another corporation.

When you start to break down the words, you start to realise what is really going on

human = monster (blacks law) 

Stop using the legal term human to describe man or woman. use mankind or man / woman.

Corp-oration = Dead speak

Necromancy:
Corp-oration = Dead speak
Summons (to the Court) = Raise the dead 

Your legal fiction (person) only exists in the realm of the dead. Corp-orations (dead entities) can only interact with other dead entities in this fictional realm. Statutes don't apply to the living.

When you are BORN, a CORP-oration with your NAME is created through your BIRTH certificate.

When your parents REGISTERED your birth they actually created a CORP-oration and handed OWNership of that CORP-oration and YOU over to the STATE.

This is WHY the STATE CAN TAKE CHILDREN from families and not be classed as kidnapping. They OWN your child.

They parents own 1/10th. The state has 9/10th, possesion is 9/10th of the law.

Because you registered the child, the state has 9/10ths of the child. There is another 1/10th of the child floating around 
somewhere. The government has claimed that 1/10th. We have to get the Birth Certificate within 48 hours of tasking the child.

The Birth Certificate makes it clear who owns the slave. In legal terms they are only entitled to the Birth Certificate, not the child.
To take the child on the pretense that they are this legal entity is theft, so in legal terms it is kidnapping, but social services can
use legal kidnapping, as long as it has the stamp legal. The same thing applies to your car or vehicle. You are the registered 
keeper, not the registered owner. The registered items are the only items that can be taken.

The same things also happen when you register a car. You get a document back saying you are the registered keeper (not the owner).

Both a child and a car can be taken away from you since they are registered, and you are left the keeper, not the owner. Same goes for your house.

If you don't pay tax on your car (as keeper/user of their property) then they will come and take the car.
In the legal world, taking anything from someone without a legal mechanism to do so is theft. 

The legal system can NOT deal with humans. It can only deal with pieces of paper (corp-orations).
A person is a type of corp-oration. Only Common Law can deal with Humans.

At your birth, they created a piece of paper, with your name on it, in capitals, just like any other corp-oration.

This is all done to dupe later in life, to believe you are the legal entity and NOT YOU.
Imaginary penalties and costs are imposed on the strawman and you, thinking you are it, pay them.

This legal fiction is kind of like an overcoat, as soon as they invite you to put it on and you do so, they can 
grab hold of the overcoat and throw you in jail. You are not in jail in a legal sense, your overcoat is.

Until you put that overcoat on they cannot do anything to you.

The deception is done through words and language.

### Legalese

Legalese is jargon that no-one understands. No one questions it. Everybody is taught incorrect, but because everyone is taught incorrect they believe it is correct.
Legalese is designed specifically so that no one can understand it, except those who are supposed to be enforcing it.

Many English words have more than one meaning. The Law Dictionary is a separate dictionary with specific legal re-definitions
for many common words. In the Law Dictionary, person can mean company or corporation.

If you tell a lie often enough it becomes truth. For legalese, even Policy-men and magistrates don't understand it, or even judges in many cases.

"Legalese is one of the few social evils that can be eradicated by careful thought and disciplined use of a pen.
It is doubly demeaning: first it demeans its writers, who seem to be either deliberately exploiting its power to dominate
or are at best careless of its effects; and second it demeans its readers by making them feel powerless and stupid"
- Martin Cutts, Ocford Guide to plain English, 3rd ed.

## Income tax and Government

Tax is the only way better than fractional reserve banking to starve a community. It wouldn't be that way if the tax was 
actually spent on the people and on the land, but it is not. We would be living in amazing communitites if tax was used for us the people, 
what we think tax is for. Other than fraud, it is the only debt that can deprive you of your liberty, the only debt that can put 
you in jail is tax evasion or tax fraud.

"If a thousand people were not to pay their tax-bills this year, that would not be a violent and bloody measure, 
as it would be to pay them, and enable the State to commit violence and shed innocent blood. This is in fact the 
definition of a peaceful revolution, if any such is possible" - Henry David Thoreau

"In general, the art of government consists of taking as much money as possible from one party of citizens to give it to the other"
- Voltaire

Income Tax in the UK was started in 1799 as a temporary measure to cover the cost of the Napoleonic wars.
It is still a temporary tax today, which expires each year on the 5th of April and has to be renewed as a provision 
in a Financial Bill.

Income Tax was withdrawn in 1816 but was reinstated in 1842 and has stayed since. Because of this, Humans are the only 
beings on Earth who pay to live on it.

The government does not own the product of your labor. If they did, you would be a slave. Since they do not own the product of your labor,
Taxation can rightfully be defined as theft or more accurately extortion and blackmail. 
No Man can own another and so no man can own the fruits of another man's labor. 

Most people will argue it is a necessary evil and that it is needed, because the government says that it is.
How else would we pay for hospitals, police, roads etc? Reaching into your own pocket is noble. Reaching into someone else's 
pocket with force is despicable. 

Imagine I own a construction firm. I demand 10k to build an extension or I'll take all your stuff and throw you in a cage.
Essentially, that's what the government does when they tax you. They say they will supply you witth services and protect you, 
but if you don't pay, just like the mafia, they come after you and use force and violence to get the money out of you.

Most people don't see look at these situations from these angles and so rarely see the deceptions constantly being pulled over our eyes.
A large percentage of our taxes are spent on:
- War
- Bailing out banks
- Paying off national debt

Around 47% of your income is spent on tax. You get to keep little more than 50% of your wages.
No wonder both parents have to work, and work constantly, unlikely families just 50 years ago. 
You are a slave, in a methaphorical cage, just like Neo, which you cannot touch, see or smell.
A Prison created by the mind of man. Governments essentially run Human farms and feed you the perception of freedom.
The primary function of government is to trick money out of your pocket and feed it into their business, so they
can continue on with wars, deception and Human farming, all in plain sight. 

The government has NO lawful basis for what they do. They might claim they have a legal basis, but legal is 
based on contract. This is a prison without bars or walls, a prison of the mind.

The main implication of NOT paying tax, is that you will grow a set of balls and become a Adult.

"A goverment that robs Peter to pay Paul can always count on the support of Paul" - George Bernard Shaw

## What is money?

1. A store of value or purchasing power
2. A medium of exchange ie. an asset that sellers will accept as payment
3. a unit of accounting, used to measure the value of goods and services

Money arose from Goldsmiths, who retained gold in their safes in exchange certificates of proofs of deposit.
People then started to trade the certificates, since this was easier than to obtain and exchange the gold itself.
The gold smiths realised, they could make a lot of money just looking after other people's valuable goods.
The certificates were backed by gold and eventually became paper money. The gold smiths realised, that 
very few people ever redeem their gold, and so they started giving out loans, in the form of deposit notes,
knowing he only needed around 10% in reserve as that would cover, even on a busy day, the amount of people
at most, who would redeem their gold. This was the birth of fractional reserve banking (only having a fraction 
of the backing for the outstanding loans).

Money has been backed and given as store of value, by the silver standard and gold standard.
Meaning you could redeem a note for gold, just like it says on paper currency.

On September 21, 1931, the gold standard was abolished in the UK and on August 13, 1971, in the US.
Since 1971, the majority of countries inthe world use Fiat currency, which is money backed by nothing, and has no value.
It only has value, because we all are made to believe it has value and because we are ordered to pay taxes and fines with this
fiat money. The only authorities who have the authority to create money are the treasury and the banks, and they
create it out of nothing.

"The essence of the contemporary monetary system, is creation of money out of nothing, by private banks' often
foolish lending" - Martin Wolf (Chief Economic commentator, Financial Times)

Only 3% of money is physical, 97% is electronic. The electronic money is completely controlled by the banks.

The banks create money out of nothing (no time or work), then lend it to you at interest, in exchange for your time and effort (human energy - work)
to pay back the loan. Money is essentially a claim on human labor and can also be defined as debt.

The banks need you to create a promisory note in the form of an agreement. A promisory note is a species of money, 
and when you complte and sign the agreement, the document now has value, just like a bank note.

At the heart of  money lending is a massive fraud, you create the money with the authority of your signature and 
the creation of a promisory note that the banks then securitise, making them more money. Then the bank makes you believe,
that you've borrowed the money and require you to pay it back with interest. 
This works exactly like the Registration scheme.

A Promisory note is:
- a promise to pay
- created by you, the debtor

A Bill of Exchange is:
- an order to pay
- created by the creditor

They BOTH have value.

The banks create a certain amount of money, but then they want more back. But that interest, that they want more back,
doesn't exist and CAN never exist. Two things have to happen as a result, the amount of money has to increase
exponentially. More on top of more. It's also like a game of Musical Chairs. There are never enough chairs to go around, 
so someone is always going bankrupt, since there is never enough money in the system to service the debt with interest (that is not there!).
This all creates the poverty and crazy competition and never enough to go around.

Why don't they teach us anything about money in school? Money it the most important thing in our society.
They don't teach us because they can't! It's a confidence trick.
If we knew the truth, we would revolt and not play their rigged game.
Everything is completely the reverse of what we all believe. We think money comes from somebody else,
but it actually comes from us.

Wen you get a loan, they present you with a loan agreement, which is in fact a Promisory Note.
A Promise to pay back X amount (in some time frame and schedule). They then monetise that promisory note to 
an account and cash it. Then they loan you back the money which YOU just created by your signature, demanding
that you have to pay back what you already created and they already monetised. The transaction for the 
house was already done with the creation of the Promisory note (monetised to money) in exchange for whatever is
being purchased by the loan, such as a house or car. 

Fundamentally a Promisory note is a promise to pay, an IOU (I Owe You). Companies often trade with each other using
Promisory Notes. The Central Banks and the Governments have taken away all the value to the Promisory Notes used to pay,
so that they now have NO VALUE. Promise to pay 1 pound. 1 pound of what? It's not 1 pound of anything. 
It's just like Monopoly money.

We asked a Bank Manager, if we came with a Promisory Note, would you have to accept it? 
And he said: "Yes, of course I would. By law I HAVE TO"
The Corporations have to abide by their statutes. We can use their statutes against them.

Along with the Remittance Slip, people have created a Promisory Note, "I promise to pay the bearer X amount".
That then becomes a species of money according to the exchange act.

The Promisory Note needs to carry a signature and a date. The Promisory Notes in your pocket (Great Britain pounds)
are actually "kind of invalid" as they don't have a date, but they have the wording "On Demand" which is a 
sort of date specifier (any date). Doing this you are not "getting away with stuff". They are getting away with it.

I'm not just giving away my signature anymore. Your signature is your most powerful thing on this planet.
It is literally worth an almost unlimited amount. WE have the power.

You can go into a bank and take a 100.000 pund loan. What do they take in exchange? Your signature. Just your signature.
When you write that Promisory Note you have created money.
Money is your promise to pay, your promise to work, use your energy, that's all there is - your (unlimited) energy.
That is what money really is. You supply it, not banks.

"The modern banking process manufactures currency out of nothing. The process is perhaps the most astounding 
slight of hand that was ever invented... If you want to be slaves to the bankers, and pay the cost of your 
own slavery, then let the banks create currency" - Lord Josiah Stamp, Director of Bank of England (1937)

"It is well enough that the people of the nation do not understand our bankind and monetary system,
for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before the morning" - Henry Ford

33:13

Common Law (Law of The Land)

1. Do not breach the PEACE ie. harassing, intimidating, tresspassing etc.
2. Cause no one any HARM (intentionally) ie. physically cause harm (hurting)
3. Cause no one any LOSS (intentionally) ie. stealing or damaging property
4. No mischief in any promises and agreements ie. cheating

Statutes are all the rules of Society. A society is a club which you can join to become a member.
In any Society or Club, you are always free to cancel your membership and leave it.
Most European countries both have the UK statutes and European statutes. So you've literally got
hundreds of thousands of rules which you are expected to follow in your daily life and that we could be 
breaking without knowing.

Legal is always according to contract. Statutes are passed by Parliament, but you have to actively contract (consent)
before they become law. The Parliament creates Bills (proposals) which then become Acts of Parliament.

Because Parliament is a creation of Man and any creation of Man can never bne above Man, they need your consent before
they have the force of law.

We obviously have Police because we want them, but only as Peace Officers (securing the peace), not as Law Enforcement Officers (enforcing statutes - ie. collecting fines).
We need to give consent to be polised by these people and for them to police in our benefit (provide security).
There is an assumption, that anyone who walks upon this land has given consent to being polised by these people.
It's an assumption most police officers live by, but which is not true.
Diplomatic immunity is an example where consent is NOT given and the police don't have the power to act.
The police also has no power at all at the American embassy f.ex, yet that is on our land. 
This is an example which shows that Jurisdiction is portable. It is not tied to the land, it is tied to the party.
So I can carry my Jurisdiction with me, the principle of self retained General.

Self retained means to keep your details to yourself. No action can be taken by an agent (corp) to make you provide information so that they can fill out their form or ticket with your private information.
Don't give into it. Protect your privacy because you cannot control where it goes, so it's for your safety

"By consent", means that for a Law to be passed, for it to be Lawful, it has to have the consent of the people
and consent to abide by it. In our current system, people don't realise, that by verbally agreeing with a 
police officer, such as for a parking ticket, you enter into a verbal contract, you are agreeing or consenting to being bound by the law.

When the police officer asks, "do you under-stand?" He speaks in legalese and is really asking: "Do you stand under our authority?"
Most police officers don't even know or realise this. People need to consent to a statute law for it to apply to them in a legal sense, because it is not Common Law.

When you interact with the police or court system, they will ask you for:

- Name
- Date of Birth
- Address

This is done to create joinder between you and the person and to trick you into representing it.
Once you agree to represent your legal fiction they can deal with you.

They can only apply their legal mechanisms when they have the name of the slave they are dealing with.
If you don't give them you name, they can't deal with you, since their system only operates on paperwork.

You are never obliged to give your personal details (ie. details of your person). They will say you must give 
them your details, but you must is simply another way of saying you may.

If you haven't broken any laws, you don't have to interact with the police or anyone you don't want to.
You are free to walk away. If they want to detain you, they need resonable ground to do that.
If they don't have that, they are in breach of their Oath and commercially liable (can be sued).

Black's Law dictionary:

A statute is a legislative rule of a society given the force of law by those who consent.

You can always say: "I do not consent" and "I do not under-stand" (stand under your authority) and 
they can do nothing, since the statute does not apply and they lose any authority.

"Are you operating under your Oath of office?" meaning, the Law of The Land (Common Law)

If they handcuff you and drag you to the station and try to bully you to give your name, it is 
violence and torture and they can be sued for damages (commercial liabilty).

We are all equal under the Law (Natural Law of the Land) and Innocent until proven guilty.

Aleays ask "Am I detained? Or am I free to go?". Do not give your details. Ask if you are 
obliged to give those details or answer any questions. If they force you, tell them you are 
"acting under durress" (not Lawful).

### The Police Ooath

I [name] of [police force name], do solemny and sincerely declare and affirm, that I will voluntarily 
serve the queen in office of constable with fairness and integrity, diligence and impartiality 
uphold the fundamental human rights and accord equal respect to all people and that I will, to the best 
of my power cause the peace to be kept and preserved and prevent all offenses towards people and property
and that while I continue to hold said office, I will to the best of my skill and knowledge, discharge all 
the duties thereof faithfull according to law"

Ask: "Are you on your Oath?" and they will often change their behavior, because their Oath is to uphold the 
common Law of the Land and not the Law of the Sea, of Commerce. Everything now has to do with Commerce.

When the Policy-man stops you, "You are not wearing a seatbelt". 
You: "Well, who am I causing harm to?" (ie. "victimless crime")
"Where is the loss or damage?" It's crazy!

"But, you're breaking the law!"
"No, I'm just breaking a rule, but I have never given whoever came up with this rule to have authority, and 
no man is above another - we are all equal, unless explicitly and willingly given authority.
You have never given them that authority.

The objective of every police officer is to preserve the property, life and subjects of the Queen.
People, property, disturbances. I pro,mise to surve the queen and her subjects, prevent them 
from being harmed and their property from being destroyed. That's all it should really mean to be a Constable (Peace Officer). 

Every Police officer takes an Oath of office, without really understanding what it means. It is never explained in detail.
It's a gray area, which you take to mean whatever you want. It has all ben setup, to allow the system which currently
enslaves people, to carry on enslaving further, into every aspect of our lives.

A Public Servant is obliged to identify him or herself by name when asked. If you ask a Police officer if they know their Oath, 
they most often don't. 

The Police Oath is the legal instrument that gives them their power (authority), ethical guidance and jurisdiction.
The fact that the majority of Police don't know their Oath and often break it, is a grave issue for us all.

When interacting with the police:

- Always wear a camera and film the interaction

You are allowed to film the Police officer in the Public domain, not in his Private domain (when he is just another private citizen, obviously).

- There are no powers prohibiting the taking of photographs, film or digital images in public places. Therefore, members
of the public or press should not be prohibited from doing so.
- We must acknowledge the citizen journalism is a feature of modern life.
- Unnecessarily restricting photography is unacceptable, as it undermines public confidence in the Police
- Once an image has been recorded, the Police have no power to delete or confiscate it without a court order

Anyone can film anything they choose to in a public area or in their own private property.

Stand up for your rights and don't let anyone tell you otherwise

The only exception is The Powers of the Polices to Stop and Search - Section 60 (Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, 1994)

Searches are all based on Section 1 of PACE - Police And Criminal Evidence Act (1994)
Download the Document and carry it with you, f.ex on your mobile phone.

Only applicable if the police officer believes:
- that incidents involving serious violence may take place in the locality and that it is expedient to give
  an authorization to prevent this
- that persons are carrying dangerous instruments or offensive weapons in the locality without good reason

These special powers may only be granted for up to 24 hours in that locality (town or suburb)

All other searches must follow GO-WISELY below:

Grounds - What are the grounds for the search?
Object - Object of the search. What do they expect to find?
Warrant -If in plain clothees, must show Warrant card
Identity - The officer must identify himself
Station - The officer must tell which station they are from
Entitlement - You are entitled to a copy of the search record
Legislation - What search power is being used
You - YOU must be told you are being detained for the purpose of a search

Always tell the officer that you are alarmed and distressed and that you are being searched under duress.
Make it very clear you do not agree with the search, and don't sign the papers, or only 
while writing "under durress" on any such form. Signing the paperwork means you agree to being searched.
Always film your encounters with the police.

When you pull your camera out, you will most often see the police change attitude and work to a more 
professional standard (as they know they are more liable for their actions and misuse of power).
You also have evidence of the encounter in case the police officer makes false allegations against you.

If the Police doesn't now follow Go-WISELY, the search will be considered unlawful and an assault charge 
can be filed against the officer or officers.

The 3 main points to challenge are: Grounds, Object and Legislation. What are the grounds and object of 
the search and what laws allow him to do this. The police have to justify why they have stopped you to search you.

Not conducting a search correctly or understanding the lawful basis is gross misconduct on the officer's part.

### Section 163 Road Traffic Act

If you are being stopped by the police under the Road Traffic Act, which allows the police to stop "A person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle"
You can argue that you are not a person and that you are not driving, you are just traveling.

They will then go on to section 164, which gives them the power to ask for your drivers license, so they can confirm your details 
and that you are legally allowee to drive the car.

Since this is an act, there is no law stating you must give your name. But by having a drivers license, registering your car and
paying road taxes, you have thought of agreed to the Road Traffic Act already. The best advice is to stay in 
your car and roll down the window, just enough so you can communicate. The police have no right to ask you to step out of your vehicle.
Ask them why they have stopped you. If they reply section 163, 164 or 165 of the Road Traffic Act, it is just to check documents.
You can given them your license and nothing more. According to the act, you can submit papers (including insurance) at a Police station 
of your choice within 7 days. The police have no right to grab your key. If you wish, respecfully decline to answer
any further questions. Officers have to be in uniform to enforce the statute (Act) or any statute or Act in general, that does 
not contain a criminal element.

We are all born free! We all reserve the right to travel unimpeded.
Stay in your power and stand up for your rights.

### IMEI Phone Checks

The Police have started to take Phones to check the IMEI number. They use this trick to get your details, including name etc.
Everybody has a phone, so they have no grounds to suspect it is stolen. The Police have no rights to asks for your phone.
You are not obliged to give them your phone. What are their grounds to suspect your phone is stolen?

### Breach of Peace

Breach of Peace is an old Common Law concept which is used to prevent violence against people or property.
A Breach of Peace is not a criminal offense in itself, however special powers exist for the purpose stopping 
or preventing anyone from Breaching or Threatening a Breach of the Peace, by committing unlawful violence.

A Breach of the Peace are action which harm another person or his property in his presence or which are 
likely to provoke such harm. It may occur on either public or private property.

An arrest can be made only to remove someone from the situation or if an imminent threat is reasonably anticipated.
This means, that if you are arrested for breach of the peace, or to prevent a breach of the peace, you can not be 
charged or prosecuted, as it is prevential power.

### Public disorder

Section 5 (Public Order Act) is perhaps the most abused power the Police have in their arsenal.
A Police officer can arrest anyone without a warrant if he believes you are in breach of this section.
Since 2010 the word "insulting" has been removed, to be in line with Article 10 of the Human Rights Act.
This means you can say anything you like as long as it is not aggresive in nature or provoking violence.
The best advice is to stay calm and not swear or make threats. A long as you have not broken the law by causing harm, 
injury or loss to a fellow human, you will be fine. Most Police officers respect being respected, and you will 
have a greater chance to move on with your day if you do so. Always stand up for your rights.

Arcticle 3 of the Human Rights Act, states: "No one, shall be subjected to torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment"

If the police forces you to the ground and uses violence against you, in order to attempt to force you to comply, 
they are breaching this act. Another example of this is breaking someones window, to enforce a law - essentially breaking a 
law to enforce a law.

The Police need to go back to policing, protecting people and property. Upholding rules should never be done by force.
No one has the right, to tell you what you should and should do or how you conduct your life, if you haven't broken any laws.
If someone had that power over you, then you would be a slave. Think about it.

Statutes and Acts that contain no criminal element are essentially corporate rules and can be seen as requiring consent.

No one ever asked, if you agreed to these rules, it was just done by presumption. So rebut that presumption if you wish.
You should ask for proof that you have consented to these rules, instead of stating "I do not consent".

We are all equal in the eyes of the law and innocent until proven guilty.

### Debt

Money does not exist, it is a figment of our imagination and is backed by nothing. When you borrow money from a bank,
they don't take it from their vault and give it to you. Instead, you fill out an agreement, sign it and they 
type some numnbers into a computer, and presto, the money is brought into existence to be loaned to you.

For a contract to be legal, it must have equal worth. They give you nothing and expect you, to use your own human labor,
which is your most valuable commodity, to work, to pay it back. This alone renders the contract void.

Debt and the whole industry associated with it, is central to the control system that surrounds you. 
Possibly the only time you feel intimidated in your life, is for police encounters for non-criminal activities
and when you owe money to a creditor and then consequently the debt collector or bailifs come after you.

Contracts and debt can never be remedies by force. We will show you that debt collectors and bailifs have no powers, except
in very extreme circumstances and only as a last resort. Even when force is authorised, it is classified as reasonable force
and can not be used against a human. Owing money is NO a crime, and you can never go to prison for not paying a debt.

The whole of the debt industry runs on fear and ignorance.

Now if debt collectors call me, the first thing I say is: 
Me: "Thank you very much for paying off my debt. That's really kind of you".
Him: "What do you mean?"
Me: "Well, you bought my debt, maybe just for 10%, but as far as I'm concerned, you've paid off my bank account"

The whole system is designed to get us into debt. A debt which cannot be paid off. So there is no reason to feel guilty.
The fact is, that it doesn't matter how many cuts we make (austerity), we cannot possibly pay of the debt, because debt is the 
money itself and there is never enough money in the system to pay off the cumulative interest rate. 
That money has and can never been loaned into existence without creating even more debt, and so on indefinitely.

If it wasn't for this pyramid scheme of a money system, we would have abundance.

People assume that when debt collectors come around, that they have actual power to do something to you.
In actuality they have absolutely NO power whatsoever. They ONLY have the power YOU give to them.
They are 3rd party interlopers or technicalla "a third party intervener"

They are interfering in your financial affairs. You didn't contract with them 
and don't know who they are. They bully or trick you into contracting with them. If you contract with them, they
can legally chase you for money. One trick they use is to say: "Give us just 1 pound per month"
Most people feel that sounds reasonable if they feel guilty and truly believe they have a debt to pay.
But as soon as you start paying them, you have contracted with them, so now you have to pay the full amount.
Debt collectors generally disappear as soon as you show them you know your rights and know what you are talking about.
They are only there to bully the weak, who don't know how to take a stand and don't know what their rights are. 

"The only person that owes a debt, it the person who worries about it" - it's as simple as that

Don't worry about your debt. It's NOT real.

The most important thing when dealing with anyone or any situation, is to get informed. If not, you are at their mercy.
Understand your rights and understand their rights (what they can do and NOT do). Then you are in a much better position
to defend yourself.

No one has power over you. The system is just an illusion, created by the mind of man. Owing momney or breaching a contract
can never be remedied by force. knowledge is your most powerful weapon.

### Dealing with Debt

The simplest method:

"Addressee unknown - Retun to sender"

You are NOT the title (mr, mrs) or the person (name in capital letters).
When dealing with the bank, simply ask:

- "Where did the money come from?"
- "Do I have a valid contract with you?"

If you can't prove these points, then we agree to the following terms: debt null and void
Send the letters 10 days apart (certified mail) to give them time to respond.

GetOutOfDebtFree.org contains template letters where you fill in the blanks. This approach has
helped thousands get out of debt. The forum on the site also provides a treasure 
trove of information and experiences from people having been in similar situations and community 
support in general.

As part of the letters sent back, is a fee schedule. Any more communication beyond this point 
will cost them, according to the fee schedule.

If they continue harasing you, start sending them invoices. If they don't pay the invoices you can go
to the small claims court online and start pursuing them for the money.

The only power they have over us is FEAR. You have NO OBLIGATION to deal with debt collectors.
Always let them know that you will charge them money for any future time with you.

The debt collectors have actually already bought off your debt (at a discount). So your debt no longer exists.

"Can you give us a copy of the contract, signed by both parties?" ie. you and the debt collectors.
Obviously no such contract exists. In general, we (as human flesh and blood) can never contract with 
a fictitious entity (legal fiction or corporation).

### Debt collectors of Bailifs at your door

Debt collectors have no right of entry. If they make threats, then they are breaking the law.
Normally sending the 3 letters and an estoppel is enough to make them stop and go away.

If you go outside, bring a camera and film the encounter. Tell them that you do not want to deal with them.
Tell them you will only deal with them via post or over the phone. Tell them to leave you alone.
If they continue or make threats, call the police. They will have no warrant, as it is a civil case.
They have NO power, only empty threats.

Bailifs have very few powers, if any. First send them a "Removal of Implied rights of Access".
This remove the Bailif's Common Law right to access your property. From there on, as soon as he
sets foot on your property he is committing tresspassing, which you can sue him for.

Put this notice on your door or gate if he comes onto your property. If you go out to meet and speak to him,
go out with a Notepad, pen and a Camera - taking notes. In this situation they will realise they are being 
challenged and will most likely back off. Also ask them: "Can I pleae see a signed Warrant from the court?"
The Warrant must have been signed by an actual Judge. In the very unlikely case that the Bailif can produce such as document
make a copy (photo) of the Warrant and contact the court, to ensure that the signature is indeed by a real Judge.

Bailiffs are like Vampires. You have to allow them in once in order for you to contract with them and give them the 
power to enter your property.

They might state: Once we have a "walking possesion order" we can legally go in and remove possesions. But they never have such an order until you have invited them in.
If they touch you it is assault. So if they try to push past you to get access, it is assualt, and the entry is illegal.
Never let them in. Make sure the property is locked at all times.

Only in exceptional circumstances, such as:
- Commercial Court Fines
- Income Tax Arrears
- Property is Commercial Premises

Can reasonable force be used to gain entry. But only as a last resort when all other avenues have been exhausted.

Control of Goods Act, Schedule 12:

"A power to use force does not include power to force against persons, except to the extent that regulations provide
that it does"

Criminal Law Act, 1997, Part II

From "Offences relating to entering or remaining on property"

"Any person, who without lawful authority, uses or threatens the use of violence for the purpose of securing entry
into any premises for himself or for any other person is guilty of an offense"

Gov.uk website

Bailiffs must usually give you 7 days notice of their first visit.

You usually don't have to open the door to a bailiff or let them in
Bailiffs can't enter your home:

- by force, eg. push past you
- if only children under 16 or vulnerable people are present
- between 9pm and 6am
- through anything except the door

You:

- A Human being
- Human Rights are absolute
- Only unto the law
- The highest Authority

Bailiff:

- Works for a corporation
- Has a fictional title, representing a fiction
- No rights to use force
- Has some sort of court order

Police Officer:

- Public Servant (you are the Public)
- There to prevent a Breach of the Peace

There are plenty of case laws that show that the aggressor is the one to be arrested

Redmond-Bate v Director of Public Prosecutions. The Times lulv 28. 1998
Nicol and Selvanayagam v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996)
R v Howell (1981) 73 Cr.App.R.31

Only a sufficiently real and present threat to the peace justified depriving a citizen, 
not at the time acting lawfully, of his liberty

The threat must come from the person being arrested

The conduct must clearly interfere with the rights of others and its natural consequence must
be "not wholly unreasonable violence" from a 3rd party  

The conduct of the person to be arrested must be unreasonable

You cannot obstruct a Bailiff from his duties.

"The debtor cannot initiate violence but the degree of resistance may be matched to the force 
being used to try to get in." Weaver v Bush (1795), Simpson v Morris (1813), Polkinhorne v Wright (1845)

Fisher & Lightwoods Law of Mortgages 13th edition "If physical possesion is to be taken it must be taken peaceably"

1981 R v Howell: Is the Authority for defining a Breach of the Peace

"There is a Breach of the Peace whenever harm is actually done or is likely to be done to a person or in his 
presence to his property or a person is in fear of being so harmed through an assault, an array or riot, 
unlawful assembly or other disturbance"

Bibby vs Chief Constable of Essex (2000) Court of Appeal

Bibby spells out for police officers - "Make sure you identify where the threat is coming from, IF you have time that is"

"The Officer had no right to force his way into the respondent's house, which was the respondent's castle.
Whether the officer was known or not, this was illegal and therefore he was not in the execution of his duty at all
when he was assualted. He seems to have provoked the assault. As he was clearly not in the execution of his duty
our judgement is for the respondent."

Sir Alexander Cockburn on Broughton v Wilkerson where Wilkerson defended himself against bailiffs using force 
trying to get entry.

Lord Losh also commented:

"Every man's house is his castle. That has been settled long ago, and a bailiff cannot force his way 
inside to lay execution for a debt. It is impossible to read this case and say that the bailiff was 
in execution of his duty."

Vaughan v McKenzie (1969) where Bailiffs used force to enter and were opposed by the occupier

Lord Parker: 

"Ms McKenzie was perfectly entitled to resist entry being made against her will and if force is used, 
she could oppose it with reasonable force."

Debunking the common myth, that a bailiff can gain entry by breaking open a door or use a foot to stop
a door being closed. A bailiff placing a foot in the door is a trespasser and any levy attempted after this
is invalid and the entry to the premises may be resisted.

### Final thoughts

There is no way to live free in this land. I wanted to buy some land and live free from the system.
The system will not allow you to do that. The system will come for you and kick you off your own land
and force you to live the way they want you to live. 

People need to get educated and start realising what is going on around them. Generally people tend to 
only give a damn when it is on their doorstep and it is happening to them. We can't wait for that to happen,
because we've got a system built around us that has completely taken over every aspect of our lives.

To people who are worried about debt, don't worry about it. Worry about the important things in life, real things
like the people close to you, family, kids. Never get a mortgage (death contract) - always buy in full or even better,
have the registration canceled and your initial signature count as full payment, voiding the mortgage payback.

To change the world, we all ned to come together and work on fixing all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle.

The people stand above the government
The government stand above citizens

Citizenship was actually created with the abolition of the slave trade, so that slaves could be given the
same rights as free people but without the same power. The citizens were always going to be ascribed their
rights and responsibilites, by the government, so they could keep a finger on the ex-slaves. Now that has been
applied to everybody. It's been completely normalised that everyone is a citizen, who ONLY has rights and responsilities,
because the government gave it to them and their standing as The People will be long forgotten by them.

The sadness in this, is that there are a lot of people out there, that are involved in the commercial construct,
and are doing something every day for ONE reason, TO SURVIVE. They have to go to work every single day and know,
 that what they are doing is not moral, but they HAVE to do it, because they feel there is no other way they 
 can support their family. They are taxed to the hilt. Everything they have got, they are threatened with its removal
 if they do NOT comply. That's a very sad situation. This means that the human mind is being controlled by a construct
 and can't escape that construct. It gets worse day in and day out. 

 Ignorance is our fault, not being up to speed on what's going on is our responsibility, we are giving our 
 power away to people who are using it against us. People need to wake up to what is really going on before it's 
 too late. Stop looking at the mainstream media and newspapers, start looking at some information that is 
 real and relevant, otherwise we will all be micro-chipped and controlled. We can barely do anything now, having to 
 ask permission to demonstrate agains the government. Our freedoms are being taken away by the day and people are 
 NOT noticing because they are being distracted. We need to be adults and open our eyes. 
 We need to see what is happening, otherwise we will be in this New World Order, one system of control, and we're all
 going to be slaves in every sense of the word. That's the way it is going and the true reality of the world we live in 
 at the moment.

### 1666 London fire

The London Fire of 1666 (666 - Mark of the Beast) started in Pudding Lane. Like when Rome burned, when London burned there were great changes being made. 
Subjugation of Men's and Women's rights. Subjugation is the action of bringing someone or something under domination or control.

[Cestui Que Vie Act 1666](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Cha2/18-19/11)

An Act for Redresse of Inconveniencies by want of Proofe of the Deceases of Persons beyond the Seas or absenting themselves, upon whose Lives Estates doe depend.

In effect, all the Men and Women of the United Kingdom were declared dead and lost beyond the seas.
The State took every body and everyones property under trust and the State became the Trustee husband (to inherit)
to hold all the titles and properties of the people, until a living man or woman comes back and claims their titles.
When they do prove that they are alive, then their titles can be revested and claimed for damages.

This act is still enforced to this day. This scheme has been ongoing to this day, where everybody born are immediately "claimed dead and lost at sea" through their person.

It is essentially one system for the elites (masters - alive) and another system for the res of us (slaves - dead), complete
with two separate Judicial systems, one for the (living - awake) and one for the dead (slaves - asleep).

The masters can OWN property in full, while the slaves (us) can NEVER OWN anything, including ourselves.

In the UK, at Birth you have 7 years to reclaim your title. Otherwise you are dead beyond reasonable doubt and therefore the state
takes your body and property into trust. The Fire was simply a smoke screen to pass this act, while everybody was pre-occupied with the fire.

This is why you are NOT allowed to represent yourself in court. You always need representation when involved in
legal matters since you are dead.

Similar to Tomb stones in grave yards, utility bills or court letters (Court Summons), your name is always in capital letters.
Any corporation writing to you is writing to a dead legal fiction.

When your mother informed the registrar that there was a new vessel in town (you), your dead legal fiction was created.

Birth certificates are issued at birth, just as ships are given berth certificates. Your mother has a birth canal, just like
a ship. Your vessel if floating on the sea of commerce.

The general public is still legally tied to admiralty law. Through this ancient legal construct we can be easily controlled.
Learning about your legal fiction allows you to unlock youirself. It is possible to be free from financial stress and debt.

The birth scheme, started around 1836-37, when the Birth Marriage Death Registration Act and the post of Registrar General came into being.
His job was to collect all the records from all the churches. Registrar comes from regus, who is the Queen (or King).

As all legal fiction is the property of the Crown or Queen, we are all property of Her Royal Majesty.
The Registrar General holds everybody in custody. Everybody in the UK, registered with a Birth certificate is in custody.
The legal fiction (or strawman), allows Men and Women.

1) to function in commerce 
2) to accept the benefit privileges provided by the state

[Birth Marriage Death Registration Act 1836](https://www.intriguing-history.com/birth-marriage-death-registration-act/)

A corporate entity is a benefit privilege to the strawman (legal fiction). The system can in principle be to the 
benefit to the majority of the people, but when the system breaks down, and no longer operate for the benefit of the people, 
things start going wrong. The system itself is neutral. It can work for or against the Men and Women. 
It all depends on the level of education of the Men and Women in society and who is pulling the levers.

The City of London is renowned as being a commercial center. Commerce operates under Mercantile Law which is based on Admiralty Law.

"Learn about your past and obtain control of your future."

## Owning a house (property)

Do I own my house?

Unless you get a letters patent on your land then maybe. There is a difference between real estate and land ownership, real estate is the ownership of the physical property on the land: house, shed etc... Land ownership is the ownership and the rights to the property, the difference being the rights. It was mentioned in this video however, that rights are given to you by the Government meaning your a slave. I would recommend looking into Letters Patent and sub-surface mineral rights if you haven't already. 

The procedure to obtain a Letters Patent is lengthy and can be found on youtube. It is said that a deed is not the true absolute title, it is "colour of title" having the appearance of a title but there is always a minor flaw. Mortgage companies cannot go after property or land that has a Letters Patent on it for that same reason they will not issue you a mortgage for land with a Letters Patent that's why they convert it into a deed because they can go after a deed not a Letters Patent. 

In hind sight anything with your surname on it is not yours, as your surname does not belong to you, it belongs to your family and them their family and so on. By using the surname it classifies you under a private military contract with the Roman Empire. I am Canadian here will call states provinces, the etymology of the word province: 

Middle English provynce, from Anglo-Norman province, Middle French province, from Latin prōvincia “territory brought under Roman domination" 

They own the association of your First and last name used together. As your name is only your Christian name from the house of.......

## John Harris

You have a choice to be free. You were free since the day you were born.

The police where not formed to protect and serve the general public. 
The police were formed to serve the dominant members of society from and protect them from the lower classes (the 99%).

- To protect the aristocracy from us, their goods, lifestyle etc.
- Create state controlled street life

They knew from keeping crime alive, there is a lot of money to be made there. 
The job of the police is to keep crime alive, not to solve crime.

They created a private political army and called them police. They were created by policy, they are ruled by policy and they
can't do anything outside those parameters. Police men = Policy men.

Command structure is the same as the army. Most, if not all of the chief positions are Free Masons.
They are under Papel orders (Pope, Jesuits).

Street life needed to be contained and controlled, coz they could make a great deal of money from crime.

Back in the 1740s (before Police existed), there was a man called Charles Hitchens, who was a Thief taker. 
A Thief taker would reclaim stolen property and sell it back to the people it had been stolen from.

Charles Hitchens ran a gang of thieves, who would rob people, bring it back to Charles Hitchens, then he would find out who
it belonged to and go and sell it back to them.

He eventually bought himself the position of High Sheriff of the City of London. He then continued the same scheme, 
just ran bigger gangs. He wav eventually caught doing it. He was then suspended on full pay. They investigated him.
Couldn't find anything and he was reinstated and continued doing the same again.

In the end he was arrested for sodomy and was tried for homosexuality and convicted.

If the government could get rid off all crime they wouldn't do it, coz there is too much money in it.
99% of what they "perceive" as crime, is victimless crime, like parking fines. Crime can only really exist if there is a victim.
Who harm, jnjury or loss was caused to. If you get caught speeding, who have you injured or made to have a loss?

There is a saying: "Please don't grow cannabis coz the police hate competition."

The police and the courts have a Bribery Manager. The police NOT the correctors of crime, they are the instigstors of it.
If you need to keep crime going as a relevance and earn money from it, you need to keep people in poverty.

When you complain that the police should be here to protect us, you are wrong. They are not.
They are there to earn as much money as possible. All statutes are stealth taxes and the courts are there to collect.

The money making orders called statutes, are sold to the private sector and the private sector loan the government the money to run the government.
They work out how much each statute will make and sell it to the banking fraternity. But the bankers want the principal and interest.
Let's say the statute is worth around 10 billion. The bankers will then lend 8 and collect 2 as principal.
They then get the police to enforce it and courts to collect it. These are called Guilds and are sold on Downing Street.

Downing Street was originally hosting Cock (male chicken) fighting. An Inn was named after a famous Cock Old Trodgeston.
The crooks and thieves would go to this Inn and sell their stolen wares (fencing). Same they are doing in 10 Downing Street, fencing stolen wares.

The legal landscape isn’t complicated, it’s very simple, it’s literally (and I mean literally) 
a fictional game invented by tyrannical power-greed, played out in nature, like a Pokemon cards game; 
made up rules and playable moves. In the same way religion brainwashed ancient humans, modern governments 
are doing the same (capitalism, the act of consuming governments products; perpetual illusion of social status), 
the Queen is the head of state and Church of England; government is the modern religion.

Parents or guardians are legally responsible for their ‘minors’, so this has got me starting to wonder 
if ‘minors’ have the legal power and that’s where a loophole is, to get out of this game. 
Because once you become a legal adult (human over the age that your government decides), you’re 
responsible for your own actions. You could say that if the historic leaders who pathed England to 
today lost those wars, we’d be speaking a different language or maybe not exist at all; so what, 
it would just be a different landscape.

Who gave anyone the right to have power over others? Nobody! You’re indoctrinated by a false advertised 
contract, the birth certificate; contract of citizenship to the legal country you’re born into or parents 
legal residence. Okay, let’s play their game, using their meaningless ‘legal’ structure, I think we 
should sue the government for enforcing this illegal contract (read into what constitutes an illegal 
contract, and you’ll see that the birth certificate breaches many), enabling us to reap the abused 
natural rewards of freedom (like any other organism) and let humans live on the land, on the planet, 
in the galaxy, and in the universe, which evolved them. As it’s all predicated on religion 
(the creator of the universe), and we’re in the universe, we have the platform (courtroom), we have 
nature’s evolutionary evidence, so I believe we have the ingredients to do it. Law is completely 
superficial, it doesn’t stand a chance.

The scariest part is, some of the people in ‘power’, are under the same illusion.
