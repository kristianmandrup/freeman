"Public shitizens have no rights - you have NONE. You have forfeited all rights by becoming a citizen. 
What you are giving back are privileges subject to regulation. So if you agreed to that, pay up!" - Dean Clifford

Illegal Mexican can drive without a license, without being arrested, can get government benefits, etc.
Sounds pretty good!

To be illegal and do illegal things is way better. Do don't want to be doing things legally, as that means 
you concent to and do things withing their legal system. You want to do things freely as a Human Being,
leveraging your God given right that no-one can lawfully take away from you. We are all created equal before God.

You want to ask? How do I become illegal? What did they do to legalise me at some point?
