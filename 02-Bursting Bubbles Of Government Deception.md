# Bursting Bubbles Of Government Deception

By Robert Menard [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5_PjoEBk1E)

Those who benefit from any social mechanism rarely wish to understand that mechanism
especially if it appears to grant them power, control or authority
over their fellow man and understanding that mechanism would diminish, limit or remove 
that apparant power, control or authority.
They simply do not want to know.

Because it is far easier to Ignorantly Control Others than it is to 
Wisely Control Yourself

Justice is Truth in Action

"If the single man plants himself indominantly and succinctluy on his instincts, 
and there abide, the world will come around to him"

"There is no cruder Tyranny than that which is perpetuated under the shield of Law 
and in the name of Justice" - Montesquieu (1689-1755) 

Government agents are coming up to us, telling us that we are all equal, yet make demands upon us
that we know we could never make upon them. Where is the equality?

You are NOT obliged to register your children. If you do, you create a legal entity, a person.
You are associating this person with your offspring. You are abandoning ownership and title to that person.
The government is seizing your child (person) under the laws of maritime salvage it becomes their chattel property and they can
use it as collateral to float loans or to float bonds for loans.

When they come to collect the child they are not coming for the Human Being at all. They are removing the legal entity you created and
abandoned and that they now have title to. It's like putting your neighbors jacket on the child, then your neighbor taking back 
the jacket with your child in it.

That is the person, that is what the government acts upon.

What is a Person?

* A human being is not a person because he is a human being, but because rights and duties 
have been *ascribed* to him.
* The person is the legal subject or substance of which rights and duties are attributes
* A person is NOT the Human Being but the Human's invisible coat
* A person is a fiction, a product of the mind. It is UNNATURAL.
* A person exists in association with us
* Associations between Natural and artificial entities are presumed to be for the benefit of the Natural
* A person exists for our benefit, not us for it's benefit

You ARE not a person, you HAVE a person.

It's all like the tale of the Emperor's new clothes. You believe in the fiction until you don't.

When they are acting upon your person and you are unaware of it's existence, you're a slave to your own ignorance.
Once you become aware of it's existence, you take it off at will. Since that's the only thing they can act upon you have your freedom.

If you are offering them the person without it being attached to you, they want nothing to do with that "hot potato" 

The purpose of the person wasn't to deceive you or enslave you, it was to provide you with a very strong
level of protection against government tyranny. If they never act against you as a Human Being and they only
sact against you as a person, you always have the option to reject their government and escape their tyranny peacefuly.

You do not exist for the benefit of the person. A person exists for your benefit.
Just like a raincoat exists for your benefit. If you're in the rain it's a good thing.
If it's a hot sunny day, it's something you want to remove the jacket. The same is true of your person.

They hoodwinkes us, they created a situation when they got rid of slaves, they said "ok, everyone can be a person".
If you do have slaves, then it's beneficial to be a person. If however there are no more slaves, then your 
taking the lowest level on the totem pole.

Deconstructing their Acts - The 6 tricks

- Smoke
- Mirrors
- Camouflage

Smoke

* Hides edges and definitions, it obscures
* Used to *hide* movement
* Irritates the eyes and head
* Usually precedes an attack
* Seen in excess (not needed) words, 
  changing definitions, "legalese" and bureaucratic language

F.ex in the children's act the define (redefine) the word "child" (to be the person of the child, not the Human Being child).

Mirrors
* Are they real or a reflection?
* How do you know?
* Touching reveals
* Edges and originals - why we need them
* Hidden with smoke and Camouflage
* Reflection is Equity - Reality is Law

Camouflage

* What is NOT there
* Flexible Brick walls?
* Must be hiding something (that they do not want you to know about)

Using Smoke, Mirrors and Camouflage, the reflection in the mirror will 
look like the real thing and you will not know unless you go up and touch it.

You will then always be deceived into thinking the reflection is the reality. It is NOT.

- Switch the bait
- Sliders
- Hiding the Monkey

Switch the bait

* From a distance it will appear you have an obligation - from up close, a voluntary choice
* Must and Apply - The Cheese and the Trap 
* Required - What's the sense?
* If they don't say obliged it is NOT an obligation
* What documents are they getting and who said you have to provide them?
* Prove it's a Cheese and that it's not a Trap - your choice

They will make you believe you have an obligation when you do NOT

Sliders

- Here, pick this up - says who?
- Documents and words - Not yours? then you don't have to take them
- Sliding across the counter (Applications)
- Do you "understand"? - Do you Stand Under (do you accept the offer)?
- Flip them over, see what they are (then decide if you want them)
- You won't like it

You are acting voluntarily to pick up that document. You have the right to pick it up, look at it closely, 
front and back, put it back down and say, no I don't want it

Every time you pick up and accept, it gives them authority over you.

Hiding the Monkey

The obvious hidden in plain sight
Denial of Deception
"Just trying to help"

They've trained you like a Pavlovian dog to look the other way (diversion) and not look at the monkey in plain sight.

13 Very simple things

"Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human liberty, 
it is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves" - William Pitt

Some are very simple and obvious, others are very well hidden.
These are the things that empower you. They are undeinable truths and accepted by your "opponent".
They can not be argued or disputed.

- Therein lies their power
- They establish "The Common Ground"
- They allow you to seize Moral High Ground
- They will set you free

- They are merely people
- They have no more power than any other Human Being
- They have weaknesses that can be used
- They have worries that have nothing to do with you
- You are a MEANS for them to feed their children. They NEED you
- They are trying (mostly) to do good. Give them a chance and they will do even better.
  You have to help them however. 
- They will respon to human emotions of anger, fear, shame, guilt, pain
- They respond better to love, compassion, kindness and TRUTH
- It is more likely they are a victim of the deception than party to it (low level henchmen of Evil Cabal)
- If they are your enemy, you can turn them into an ally (friend)

Always remember, they are just another Human Being in a Common Law jurisdiction.
Don't look at them as anything other than another Human Being with a tool and the tool they are using are WORDS.

Power of Words
All their power is a direct result of the WORDS they use
Without the WORDS they have NO POWER at all
You CAN USE THOSE WORDS too
If they loose some of their words they loose some of their power
If they loose ALL of their words they loose ALL of their power
Take their words and make them yours
Author your OWN words

They have to know what the words in their own mandates mean.
If they use the words against us, we will use the words against them

13 deceptive words

- They are all deceptive and most have dual meanings or senses
- Most of their power is in their deception
- It is also where you find the greatest weakness
- Deception needs IGNORANCE. You can address your ignorance even if you can't address their deception
- Truth ALWAYS destroys deception

Ask these Human Beings who are using words to claim authority some questions concerneing the deceptive words.
If they can NOT answer their authority is gone.

Statutes - Society - Consent

1) Legislated rule of society which has been given the force of Law
2) A number of people joined by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a commpon goal 

To not "Assent" (agree, accede, acquiesce, consent, concur, subscribe) does not require positive affirmation (validate, confirm).

Tricky words

- Required: Also has two senses; active and passive. Active requires an obligation. Passive does not.
  "I require a Tuna sandwich" - am I obliged to give it to me?
- Includes: Limits a definition to that which is stated.
- Otherwise: That which is not stated. "Except as otherwise allowed" means ways allowed but not mentioned, 
 NOT previously mentioned and expressly allowed.
- Statute: Legislated rule of society which has the force of law
- Society: A number of people joined by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a commpon goal 

Consent is not Assent.

Your silence and Inaction will raise the appearance of consent.
Consent can be achieved when you do nothing.

The get you to think the statutes are laws. Statutes are NOT laws. A Statute has the force of law.
Only YOU can give it that force. Without you, it has NO force (application). You need to willingly consent to the Statute.

If they write you, saying I'm your new representative and you don't rebut it, then they have authority.
If you write back and say they are not your representative then they lose that authority over you.
