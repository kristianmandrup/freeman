"When a well-packaged web of lies has been gradually sold to the masses over generations, 
the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic."

Society is NOT a prison and you are NOT my Warden.

This is a society where the government workers feel they have the right to tear apart a family without investigation and then deny the parents recourse to the law.

We are told that we live in a free society. There is no greater test of freedom then being able to leave.

A society is a group of people joined together by mutual consent to deliberate, determine and act for a common goal. Notice how there is no mention of geographical area? Being in a certain geographical area might give you’re the right to join a society; however it cannot create an obligation to join. 

The mutual consent part is very important.

What is a statute? Is a statute law? No, it is not the law, it is simply a rule which has the force of law, within a society. Statutes are the laws of a society. 
Outside of society, statutes have no effect at all.

The simple fact is if this is a free society, we have the right to leave. If we do not have that right, it is neither free, nor a society.

If our society was a house party, this is what we would see. At the food table, they are serving scraps and crumbs, while we hear them in the back kitchen whooping it up with their supplier friends (bankers). 
The waiters (government workers) are acting more and more like prison guards.

The door leading out of this party has been well hidden and hasn’t been opened for a long time. They might have even welded it shut. If we are to have a free society, then every once in a while, someone must leave. This will ensure that people know they are free to do so; someone must guard that door and ensure it opens easily. This will also allow those remaining in the house, to see what its like outside, without venturing forth themselves. If they decide its better outside, then they too are free to leave.

You can opt to leave this sick society. As a human being born in a country, you have the Common Law right to travel anywhere within it. I also have the right to join or not join societies as I see fit. I cannot be forced to consent. If I refuse to consent, none of the statutes everyone else calls laws will have the force of law with me.

On this long closed door; stand on the other side. Do things lawfully that you cannot do legally, for you are still in the house.

When I am outside your society and therefore free of its rules, this does not mean there is no law. I do not claim the right to harm another human being, damage property, engage in fraud or extortion or break contracts. I will follow the Law. I just won’t give statutes created by governments the force of law. I will achieve this by constructively denying consent to be governed.

You can travel down the road in an automobile, exercising your Common Law right to travel, and I do not have a license, without breaking the law.

You are in a society, and I am not. You have consented and I have not. You have benefits that I do not. You are free to give up those benefits for more freedom, just as I will have done.

There is not one person among you who can lawfully force me to consent to being governed, nor is there one among you who can lawfully apply society’s statutes to me when I am outside of society

Fictions arise from the law, and not law from fictions

Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to believe.
Laurence J. Peter (1919 - 1988), paraphrasing Sir Walter Scott

Speaking the Truth in times of universal deceit is a revolutionary act.
George Orwell

Man or Fiction?

Do you know what you are? Are you a ‘person’? Are you sure?

According to Black’s Law dictionary: 

A human being is not a person because he is a human being, but because rights and duties have been ascribed to him. Specifically, the person is the legal subject or substance of which rights and duties are attributes. 
But not every human being is a person, as was the case in Old England when there were slaves.

You see, you as a human being have certain inalienable human rights. Your person has certain inalienable civil rights (priviliges and duties).

Believe it or not, you are not the one paying taxes, your person is. Its not you that votes, your person does. 
You don’t get a ticket, your person does. The best way to imagine it is to imagine a human being wearing a 
coat. The human being is a ‘man’ or ‘human being’ or a ‘natural person’. 
The coat represents the ‘legal person’. The two together is referred to as ‘individual’. (Indivisible duo).

You may have many ‘persons’. They all have the same name, but have different personalities or functions. 
See, a person is not determined solely by the name, but by the rights and duties ascribed to that person. 
When you get a traffic ticket, it is almost as if they are creating a person right there solely to deal 
with that issue. Once dealt with, the person is no longer bound by it.


Say you go to vote and on the way you get a ticket. 
Can the person who got the ticket vote? 
Can you show them the ticket and use that to secure your right to vote? No you cannot. 
The two entities, although having the same name, have different sets of rights and duties, 
and therefore are in fact different persons or at least different facets of one.

Now ask yourself, where does it say that you have to have a ‘person’? 
Are you obliged to have one? 
If you do have one, can you give it up?
Why have they gone to such trouble to hide from us the fact that they act upon our persons? 
The reason is simple; they need us to be ignorant for their deception to work.

Without ignorance, all the deception in the world won’t help them hold onto their power. 
The person exists not so they can have power over us, but so we can escape the power they claim 
if it gets too onerous. If all they can act upon is our person, and we can 
disassociate from that thing anytime we want, we can be in control. 
If we are never aware it is there, we are slaves. 
That which YOU will be is entirely up to you.

Child Registration

[diagram]

When you have a baby, the government social worker that works at the hospital will approach you with some 
registration forms, telling you "you have to register your baby". 
She will hand you a form and on the cover it says in bold language:

"Every Parent must register" and "After a baby is born every parent must register the birth 
and legal name of their child".

Inside it says:

"This brochure contains an IMPORTANT form which parents must complete for every baby born in (society). 
The Registration of Live Birth form is the official record of the birth and the registration of the 
child’s legal name. Everything you need to complete the form is provided including detailed instructions 
and a pre-addressed envelope."

The brochure is designed to make you believe you have an obligation to register and if you don’t the law will get involved and you will be in big trouble.

"By law, you must register the birth and legal name of your child within 30 days of the birth. 
Naming a child and registering the birth are your important responsibilities because registration is the 
only way of creating a permanent legal record of a person’s birth. 
There is no fee to register a baby’s birth so long as it is registered within 30 days. 
Simply fill in the registration form and mail it in the envelope provided, or bring it to any 
Vital Statistics Agency office.
See back cover of this brochure for our office locations and telephone numbers."

It then states:

"At the same time as you complete the mandatory Registration of Live Birth form, you have the option of ordering a birth certificate for your newborn."

What they are actually saying?

"This brochure contains an IMPORTANT form which parents must complete for every baby born in (society)." 

This tells us ONLY the parents can complete it. The government cannot do it on your behalf. 
They use the word "must". Notice they do not use the word "obligated" or "obliged". 
"Must" is a very tricky legal word.
When they use the word "baby". They are referring to the human being; blood, flesh and bone vessel of the spirit.

"The Registration of Live Birth form is the official Provincial record of the birth and the registration of the child’s legal name."

Here they tell you the form is the (society) record. Not yours, but *Theirs*. 
They have also now slipped in the word "child" instead of "baby".

The reason is there is no doubt in law what a baby is; there is ambiguity when you start using words like "child". 
The "child", legally is the "person". Notice how also they tell you that you will be creating a "legal name". 
Not a lawful name, but a legal one. There is a big difference between the two.

'By law, you must register the birth and legal name of your child within 30 days of the birth." 

Again the word "must". And why must you do it within 30 days? What exactly is the penalty for registering late? Notice also the use of the words "child" and "legal name".

Naming a child and registering the birth are your important responsibilities because registration is the only 
way of creating a permanent legal record of a person’s birth. 

Now the trap is almost shut. "Responsibility" refers not to what one is obliged to do, but who is to blame 
after the fact. Notice here also how they are using not the word "baby" nor "child" to describe your offspring, 
they are using the word "person" and they may not be describing your offspring at all. 
They tell you straight out, by using the word "person", that you will be creating a permanent one.

"There is no fee to register a baby’s birth so long as it is registered within 30 days." 

Here is why you have to do it within 30 days! To avoid paying a filling fee! 
That is why they can get away with using the word "must" when there are no actual obligations.

"At the same time as you complete the mandatory Registration of Live Birth form, you have the option of ordering a birth certificate for your newborn." 

They also use the term "mandatory". Notice what it is referring to; it is referring to the noun not the verb. 
The action is not mandatory; the form is, if you choose to register.

Now we also apparently have some sort of option about ordering a Birth Certificate. 
If you have an option now, what makes you think you didn’t have one to begin with? 
Do you think they have an obligation to tell you what all your options are?

If what they are selling is such a good thing, why do they use so much obvious deception to get us to buy it?

So this is essentially what is happening. When you register your offspring, you are creating a legal entity or person, you are associating that person with your offspring and then you are abandoning that entity to the government, who appears to be seizing it under the laws of maritime commerce. This ‘person’ is in fact chattel property and can and is used for collateral on loans. Your registered baby is in fact a form of pledge and is worth a lot of money. Also, if they ever come for your baby acting under some legislation, it is that chattel property they are acting upon, not your offspring. But because it was all done apparently lawfully and legally, and you maintain the association between that entity and your baby, they have the right to affect your offspring.

The Birth Certificate is not just evidence of the birth; it is evidence that you have abandoned the king of documents: the Record of Live Birth. They will not accept a certified and notarized true copy of the original. Nope, they need the original itself.
Imagine creating a raincoat for your offspring, the record of creating that raincoat and evidence of ownership you give to your neighbour. He then comes over and claims the right to remove the coat, with your child still in it. That is exactly the legal mechanism they use to remove our offspring.

BIRTH. "The act of being born or wholly brought into separate existence." (Black’s 1st edition)

Note: A man or a woman is “born,” straw men are “wholly brought into separate existence.” 
Each event qualifies as a “birth.” The birth certificate documents a muddied mixture of the two events 
that allows the system to both claim that it is “your” birth certificate yet also claim to hold title to 
(not ownership of) the corporately colored straw man.

BIRTH CERTIFICATE. "A formal document which certifies as to the date and place of one’s birth and a 
recitation of his or her parentage, as issued by an official in charge of such records. 
Furnishing of such is often required to prove one’s age."  Black’s 6th edition. 

birth, birth record, and document of title, field warehouse receipt, and bond.

Note: A birth certificate is a negotiable instrument, a registered security, a stock certificate evidencing, or representing, the preferred stock of the corporation and against which you are the surety; it is a pedigree chattel document establishing the existence of your straw man, a distinct artificial person with a fictitious name; 
it is a document of title to a straw man; it is a warehouse receipt for your body; delivery receipt; 
industrial bond between you (flesh-and-blood man or woman) and the industrial society and corporate government.

The original birth certificate is generally created at the PROVINCIAL level (in rare instances city level) 
via birth documents from the hospital (for which the hospital receives $$$ from the PROVINCE for causing 
the registration of the birth) and passed to the Provincial and Federal levels, and likely elsewhere. 

Per the definition of “birth” above, the document references both the newborn and the straw man. 
Certified copies of the birth certificate may be obtained at the Vital Statistics Office. 
Your birth certificate is one of the kinds of security instruments used by the Government to obtain 
loans from its creditor, under which it is bankrupt.

According to a researcher who worked on a research project for one of the world’s largest brokerage houses 
he discovered that in the year 1936 each American birth certificate was assigned a value of $630,000.00. 

The investigative journalist’s report beginning on page xxiii confirms that (new) birth certificates today 
carry a value of $1,000,000.00 and that upon notification of the receipt of a new birth certificate at the 
Ministry of Finance, it takes out a loan for $1-million and purchases a bond, then invests the funds 
in either the stock market or bond market. The collateral for the loan for the bond issued against the 
birth certificate is you; i.e. your body, labor, and property.

A man in Santa Barbara, California who obtained his original birth certificate from the Department of Commerce (USA) 
some years ago via a Freedom of Information Act request reported the endorsements 
of 17 different foreign countries thereon. 

There may also be other types of birth documents used by the Government, or others, to obtain loans/credit.  

BIRTH RECORD. "Official statistical data concerning dates and places of persons’ birth, as well as st
parentage, kept by local government officials." Black’s 1st edition. See "birth certificate".

Note: Under "birth certificate" the definition refers to "one’s birth," and under "birth record" 
the definition refers to “persons’ birth.” “One” means flesh-and-blood man or woman; 
“person” means artificial or juristic person. See individual.

The NAME GAME is the name of the game.

[diagram]

Your name is the foundation of your identity. There can be no "person" without a name, yet there can 
certainly be a human being without a name. It is in fact an intangible thing and has worth.
Every time you interact with someone who asks for your name, they are asking you to give them something, 
which to some is the most important thing in the world. 

You have no duty or obligation to have a name though!

Plus, if they are interacting with you and they are a state agent, they are asking for your legal name, 
or the name of your "legal person". What they do not have is any proof that you have an obligation 
to have a person, which they can legally act upon.

There is a way to understand whether they are acting on the person or human being. 
Look at the spelling of the name. Is it in all CAPITOL letters? 
Is the last name first and then the given names or given name and initial? 
Then that is not you the human being, it is your legal person or ‘nom-de-guerre’. 
John-Adams: Doe is the correct way to refer to a human being. 

It is pronounced ‘John Adam, of the Doe’s’ or ‘John Adam of the Doe Clan’. 

DOE, JOHN ADAM is a legal entity and a fiction.

Have you ever read a book and upon opening it had a human being jump out in the flesh? Likely not. 
You cannot and will not find a human being in a book (unless it is a really big book); 
you can however find ‘characters’ which represent human beings. They exist only in the book. 
They are a fiction and so is the story in the book and only fictions can exist within another fiction. 
You are represented in a larger legal entity and fiction by the name of your person. 
It is your character within the fiction that the government operates within. 

Can you close the book on government? Can you refuse to continue reading?

Your Birthday

Anytime a government agent wants to deal with you they have to get you to tell them your birthday. 
Remember now, it’s a crime to give false information. 
So how do you really know when your birthday is? 
How can you answer that question without relying on hearsay or conjecture? 
Could you count at that age? Were you able to label the months and years? 
Have you ever seen your Record of Live Birth? 
If not, how can you possibly answer that question truthfully? 
How can they demand you give them that information? 
They can do it because they do not want the information so much as they want you to either 
lie or identify a person. ‘Birth’ also means to be brought wholly in to existence and also 
refers to the legal fiction or person earlier referred to.

Must Submit Application for Registration

Much of the power government has over you is a result of your actions, not theirs.

‘Submit’ means ‘to agree to bend to another’s will or to ‘leave to another’s discretion’. An agreement is a contract and must be entered into voluntarily. If you are leaving something to someone else’s discretion, it must have been yours to begin with, right? Again it is voluntary in nature. You can never be lawfully compelled to submit.

‘Application’ legally means ‘to beg, plead, petition, implore, entreat or request’ The assumption this creates in court is fivefold; 1) he who begs knows exactly what he is begging for, 2) he knows exactly what he is giving up for it, 3) he is acknowledging the authority to grant OR 4) he is creating it through transference, and 5) he is doing it all voluntarily.

‘Registration’ was historically the act of a Ship’s Captain signing over his ship and all chattel contents over to the harbour master for safekeeping. Chattel contents included the condemned, those in debt, prisoners, anything that could be bought or sold and slaves.
‘Must’ is likely their trickiest word by far. You will find it used with ‘application’, ‘submission’ and ‘registration’ extensively. They try to use it to make you think you have an obligation to act; you do not, for under law, you are never obliged to beg. If I tell you, “You must come to my party through the front door.” Does that create an obligation for you to come to my party? Or does it perhaps merely define conditions,
which have to be fulfilled in order for me to have authority over you? If you look in Black’s Law dictionary, you find that ‘must’ is sometimes ‘synonymous with may’.

One is never obliged to ‘apply’, ‘register’ or ‘submit’.

"When you take charge of your life, there is no longer need to ask permission of other people or society at large. 
When you ask permission, you give someone veto power over your life." Geoffrey F. Abert

Marry the government, or not.

Do you need a Marriage License in order to marry lawfully? 
Well the government will tell you that you do. I am here to say otherwise. 
You have the right to live together and state your intent to the community and you are in effect married. 
If you do it through the government, you are actually entering into a contract where there are not two parties, 
but three. Yeap, you are in fact marrying the government and your mate. See, a license is permission to 
engage in an action which otherwise would be illegal. Marrying within the legislated framework may require 
a license; doing so lawfully does not. Plus, that action itself which is licensed must be fundamentally lawful,
or else the licensing authority is allowing unlawful activities. You can’t get a licence to rape for instance.
Just about anything you can do within the Legislated framework under licence; you are perfectly free to do 
outside that framework without a licence.

"All law has either been derived from the consent of the people, established by necessity, confirmed by custom, or of Divine Providence."

Statutes and Society

"STATUTE. An act of the legislature, adopted under its constitutional authority, by prescribed means and in 
certain form, so that it becomes the law governing conduct within its scope. 
Statutes are enacted to prescribe conduct, define crimes, create inferior government bodies, 
appropriate public monies, and in general to promote the public welfare." Barron’s 3rd ed.

Statutory law is concerned with persons (artificial) and their privileges, duties, and obligations 
within and subordinate to collective public/government welfare. It does not, and cannot, 
deal with sovereign men and women (people). 

Anyone who answers to the name of his/her straw man, or who conducts his/her personal or commercial 
or industrial affairs in the name of his/her straw man (via licenses, permits, etc.) is subjecting 
themselves to statutory law by virtue of “benefits” and “privileges” acquired through the 
transmitting-utility straw man. This liability is removed when one accepts for value title to the straw man, 
i.e. the birth certificate.

We are led to believe everyday, that ‘statutes’ are laws. This is a bit of mendacious fallacy. 
A ‘statute’ is defined as ‘a legislated rule of society which has the force of law’. 

It is a rule and has the force of law, but only within a society. Now we must ask, what is a ‘society’? 

Society: 
"A number of people, joined by mutual consent, to deliberate, determine and act for a common goal." 

We see then clearly that these statutes only have the force of law over those who have consented 
to be a member of the society governed by those statutes.

‘Consent’ is a tricky legal concept too. It does not require any positive affirmation from you; 
your silence and inaction will suffice to raise the appearance of consent. 
Anything with the word ‘Act’ in its title is an Act of the Parliament or a Legislature 
and is in fact a statute. The simple fact is you have the right to exist without those statutes 
having the force of law over you.

I believe when Jesus spoke of not being of the existing Kingdom, he was perhaps referring to 
not being a member of the society the Magistrates where presiding over. 
Back then, the word ‘Kingdom’ referred to a structured society.

No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent.
Abraham Lincoln (1809 - 1865)

The marvel of all history is the patience with which men and women submit to burdens 
unnecessarily laid upon them by their governments.
William H. Borah

Once a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, 
it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear. Harry S Truman (1884 - 1972), August 8, 1950

You can deny consent to be governed

Consent: An agreement to something proposed and differs from assent. 

Consent supposes:

1. a physical power to act; 
2. 2. a moral power of acting; 
3. 3. a serious and determined and free use of those powers.

Consent is either express or implied. Express when it is given viva voce, or in writing; implied, 
when it is manifested by signs, actions or facts, or inaction or silence, which raise the 
presumption that the consent has been given.

Let’s suppose that someone comes up to you and says, “I am your government, pay me taxes.” 
And you then pay, have you not accepted their claim that they are your government? 
If a demand is made, it rests upon a claim.

Meeting the demand means you have accepted the claim. The word ‘accept’ implies ability to ‘reject’. 
When you reject their claim the demand has no foundation. 
At that point the claim has to be either abandoned or defended. Defending a claim means that they, 
as human beings, have to use words.

Consent is not the same as assent. It doesn’t require a positive affirmation from you. 
It is just as easily achieved through your silence as it is through your words.

The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that since Canada enjoys a Common Law Jurisdiction, 
the government’s power to govern comes from the consent of the governed. 
They did not say consent of the majority of the governed, either.

the only form of government recognized as lawful is a representative one, and representation 
requires mutual consent. I cannot act as your agent without your say so; the reverse is also true.

If you create a situation where you do not have a representative, then no one can claim that you have a 
government. If you do not have a government, who has the right to claim they are your government agent? 
Who has the right to claim that you are a member of that particular society when the defining 
characteristic of a societal member is the fact that they have consented to being represented?

Denying consent is not all that difficult; all you have to do is give notice and make them aware that 
he or she is no longer your representative. You simply fire them and tell them you will exist outside 
of the legislative framework. Since they are only allowed to provide service to the public with 
respect to the legislative framework, and you are no longer part of that framework, they can no longer 
lawfully provide you with their ‘services’.

Here’s a great question for you. As members of society, we agree through consent to give up certain 
rights and freedoms in exchange for societal benefits. If however, we do not know what rights and 
freedoms we have given up, how do we know that what we are receiving are in fact ‘benefits’? 

Would you buy a car, and not know what you paid for it, claim you got a great deal? 
If you don’t know what it cost you, there can be no benefit.
A ‘benefit’ is defined as ‘something gained through a lawful transaction where the 
receiving party feels he got the advantage or profit’. Is there any advantage or profit in ignorance? 
I do not think there is.

I also find it somewhat neat that the quote from the bible says if they ask for your ‘coat’, 
give your ‘cloak’ also. What if, (just what if), when he said ‘coat’ he meant ‘coat’ or material 
garment and when he said ‘cloak’ he meant your protective outer garment in the law, or your ‘person’. 
It does in fact ‘cloak’ us and if we give it to them, they seem to lose a whack of power.
I have looked for someone in the government who would care to dispute our right to deny consent, and 
was unsuccessful. I spoke with Attorneys in an AG’s office who confirmed it for me.

Law Maxims
• Any one may renounce a law introduced for his own benefit.
• No one is obliged to accept a benefit against his consent.
• He who receives the benefit should also bear the disadvantage.

Looking into the boxes
Look closely at just about any government form; you will see a series of boxes. 
Your name will be in one box, your DOB in another, all the information is compartmentalized 
as if they are all separate. Ever wonder why they would do that?

What is in a box is not joined to that which is in other boxes on the same page. 
There is no joinder between the two lawfully, and if you accept that there is, you must be 
entering their make believe world where things are joined even though they are separate.

Signature Protection

SIGNATURE - By signature is understood the act of putting down a man's name, at the end of an instrument, to attest its validity. The name thus written is also called a signature.

ATTESTATION - contracts and evidence. The act of witnessing an instrument of writing, at the request of the party making the same, and subscribing it as a witness.

WITNESS - One who, being sworn or affirmed, according to law, deposes as to his knowledge of facts in issue between the parties in a cause.

TO SWEAR - To take an oath, judicially administered. Vide Affirmation; Oath.

Your signature is evidence of an oath that the instrument upon which it can be found is valid. Unfortunately we live in a society where you will often be in a position where your signature is demanded or you can face consequences. You may face a threat of jail or other hardships. Under these situations you can and should write “Under Duress” before you sign the document. Doing so means your oath is invalidated. Once you have signed there are things you can write to protect your rights and freedoms. These are:

Without Prejudice – It means they can’t present this document in a court of law.

All Rights Reserved - means you are reserving all your rights. Whatever happens, the rights you had before signing you still have a solid claim to.

Non-Assumpsit – an Assumpsit is a type of contract, where duties are imposed without full disclosure. By writing this you ensure that you do not accept any obligations that are not expressly stated.

You can also copyright your name merely by putting a copyright symbol next to your name. ©

If they try using it for any commercial purpose, you can sue them, especially if their commercial activities harmed you in any way.

Show them, don’t tell them

Let’s say you are stopped by a cop. He asks for your name. You want to ensure you give him that which identifies the human being and not merely the legal entity. 

Write it down on a piece of paper like this: John-Adams: Doe. 

Use the proper capitalization and punctuation. Remember, that piece of paper is your property, 
and he better return it when you ask for it. Also, he will have to put the name in the computer 
the way you wrote it and their equipment is not set up for that. 
If he tries putting in anything but what you showed him, he is unlawfully trying to create joinder 
between you and some other person. He has no right to do that. 
It also establishes that you are a human being, not a person and he has to play in that sand box 
and act as a Peace Officer. 
Until you show them a Driver’s License, they have no right to act in a Law Enforcement capacity.

Identify this

Officers love to ask you for identification. They make it sound like you are obliged to have it, and failure 
to produce it is unlawful. Even if you ask some straight out “Am I obliged to have Identification?” 
they will incorrectly answer ‘Yes.” The argument that one is obliged to have ID falls apart when one 
looks at the fact that the only way to get government issued ID is to ‘apply’ for it. 
Who’s obliged to apply?

What is your name?

My name is an intangible security interest and is recognized as such by the Personal Property Security Act, 
which governs ALL transactions concerning security interests. 

That intangible has immense value, and here you are demanding I just give it to you, with nothing in 
exchange, no consideration in return and without knowing what you intend to do with it, or if your 
actions will devalue it in any way. Now, are you familiar with the section of the Criminal Code 
relating to the offence of extortion?

Police need TWO things; name and date of birth. It is those two things which define a person and with which 
they can claim the existence of a one. You can distinguish between a legal and lawful name and provide 
ONLY the lawful one. You can also refuse to give a date of birth, as there is no way they can claim 
this is information you know as FACT. Any information you have is merely the result of hearsay, or is 
merely custom and NOT backed by any affidavit you have ever seen. 

So how can you really know when you were born? As a human being, you simply can’t!
If you take the steps found in this book, they can never get you to agree that you are a person, 
only that you are acting as an agent for a person. They are not the government; 
they are only agents for the government. You are not a person; you are merely an agent for a person. 
Two can play their game.

Your existing Common Law right to travel

This is one of their biggest means of gaining control over us. The right to travel is so fundamental to 
our existence as a society that without it we would likely not even have one. 

As it is now, they seem to have everyone convinced that we have to get a license to be on the road in 
an automobile. This is not the case at all. We will take a close look at that right and the 
Motor Vehicle Act that they use to control your actions.

From the Motor Vehicle Act:
"motor vehicle" means a vehicle, not run on rails, that is designed to be self propelled or
propelled by electric power obtained from overhead trolley wires, but does not include a 
motor assisted cycle;

Read that carefully. See the “quotation” marks? Do you know what they mean? 
They legally mean “these words”. These “PRINTED” words. It is telling you that anytime you see those 
printed words, you know it is referring to something that has those attributes. 
It is telling you all “motor vehicles” will have those listed attributes. 
Now ask some questions. Is the definition a full and complete one? If not then it stands to 
reason that there must be further attributes, which are needed to fully describe a ‘motor vehicle’.

Think of it like this: if I say “‘apple’ means a round red fruit”, does that mean all 
round red fruit are apples? Obviously not, right? After all, there are pomegranates, grapes and 
certain varieties of exotic Asian pears. 

They are not saying that all things with those attributes are ‘motor vehicles’; 
they are saying that all motor vehicles have those attributes. See the difference?

If we look further in the same Act we find under Section 3 the following:
3 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, the owner of a motor vehicle or trailer must, before it is used or operated on a highway,
(a) register the motor vehicle or trailer with the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia,
(b) obtain a licence for its operation under this section, and
(c) obtain for it a certificate of insurance under the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act.
(2) Despite subsection (1), a trailer towed by a tractor licensed under section 8 need not be licensed.
(3) The owner must apply for
(a) registration and licence in the form required by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, and
(b) a motor vehicle liability policy in accordance with the Insurance (Motor Vehicle) Act and regulations under that Act.

Remember how to ‘apply’ is a voluntary act and must can mean ‘may’ and no one is ever obliged to beg or apply? 
Remember how there must be a missing attribute unless the definition is full and complete? 
Well this is that missing attribute which is required before something with those attributes can be 
deemed a ‘motor vehicle’. 
You as the owner have to beg to have them confer upon your automobile the status of ‘motor vehicle’.
In order to register you will have to hand over the MSO or Manufacturers Statement or Origin or the 
MNVIS (Manufacturers New Vehicle Information Statement). They then give you a Certificate of Ownership 
with two names on it; yours and theirs. Now they are part owner of that ‘motor vehicle’ and you never 
even had to register it in the first place!

The Rule of Law

The Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Constitution Act make reference to ‘The Rule of Law.’ 
Although many greater minds then mine have studied and expressed just what that is, basically it 
boils down to this:

Equality before and under the Law is paramount.
Conflict is avoidable, unnecessary, and undesirable and when it raises its ugly head is to be dealt with 
using discussion, negotiation and then if necessary, adjudication in a court of competent jurisdiction.

If you can understand this, you can use it to seize power. 
The government is not big on discussing and will try to get you into court without discussing or negotiating. 
If they succeed, you end up looking like you abandoned the rule of law. 
You will be the one apparently in dishonour. By understanding this concept, you can force them to 
discuss matters with you before going to court. If you are in agreement with him or her, 
there can be no controversy or conflict; therefore the Court has no power, because it is a place for those 
in conflict. If they refuse to discuss with you and try to drag you into court without benefit of 
discussion and negotiation, they have abandoned the rule of law and you merely have to show that 
they are in dishonour. If there is conflict, almost always someone is in dishonour. 
When two people are both acting honourably, conflict is very unlikely. 
Your goal in court, should you be unable to avoid it, is to ensure you are not the one in dishonour. 
Clearly embracing the rule of law and striving to avoid the conflict accomplish this.
Imagine you have two kids playing in the back yard and then suddenly you hear a big brouhaha. 
You go investigate and find one child with muddy hands and the other with mud all down his back. 
Who is likely to blame for the conflict? Clearly the one with the clean hands did not engage in 
mud flinging therefore they are in honour.

"It is honourable to be accused by those who deserve to be accused." - Latin Proverb

"Nothing deters a good man from doing what is honourable." - Seneca 

The Notary Protest – Lawfully Achieving Justice

The Notary is likely one of the most powerful cards in the judicial deck. He’s the Joker. 
As an Officer of the Court, he can fulfill any duty found in any statute. 
He has the power to attest, operate on your behalf, protest commercial documents and 
create administrative judgments. Here in a nutshell is what is known as the Notary Public Protest Method. 
It has been extensively taught by Victoria Joy in her seminars and is certainly sound when it comes to the 
rule of law. Based upon my experiences and studies, it will work in Canada just as well as it does in the US. 
It is based primarily on the concept of being honourable, avoiding conflict and agreeing with your 
potential adversary.

Step 1: You send them a letter by registered mail. In it you mention the rule of law and invite them 
to discuss. You are in fact extending an offer. Unless they accept your offer, they are going into dishonour.
Step 2: Three days later, you go to your Notary Public with your offer to discuss that your adversary 
either rejected or ignored and you have the Notary send it again, acting in his capacity of an 
Officer of the Court. If they again dishonour it, they have dishonoured an Officer of the Court.

Step 3: Three days after they dishonour the Notary, you have him send them a Notice of Dishonour. They are informed of their dishonour and given a chance to correct it. Again, they have three days. If they do nothing, go to step 4.
Step 4: Three days after they received the Notice of Dishonour, if they have not responded honourably, you have the Notary send a Notice of Protest. This is end game, for you have proof that you are in honour and they are not. They have lost the right to claim any conflict and they have no right to enter into negotiations. They have essentially lost. Their hands are dirty and your are not. Now you go to Step 5.
Step5: Take your Notice of Protest and bring it to a Justice of the Peace and have an Administrative Judgment entered against your adversary. Begin collection proceedings against them as you would for any court judgment.
This process can be shortened. You can use one of their tricks on them. You can state that dishonour will mean they waive their right to be served a Notice of Protest. Include in your first letter (make sure it is Notarized) a line something like this: ‘Failure to honour this offer will be deemed to mean you have waived your right to a Notice of Protest and consent to an immediate Administrative Judgment.’
If they then dishonour the offer, you take that letter to the Notary and have an immediate judgment rendered against whoever dishonoured you.

Bankrupt governments and countries?

Did you know Canada has a Receiver General? Did you know this means we are in receivership? 
Canada is in fact bankrupt. This means they have little right to engage in commercial activities. 
You can raise this issue in court and watch a Judge almost have a fit. 
Deputy Sheriffs will suddenly emerge from the walls and you might end up in gaol for a little cooling 
off period. They do not like you pointing out that the ball they are trying to kick around has no air in it.
You can also use this information if any Government agent comes after you. 
You simply tell them you do not like doing business with those you don’t know and then you ask a few questions. 

Like: 
Is Canada bankrupt? 
If so can I be forced to contract or transact with a bankrupt entity? (NO, you can’t)

Acceptance for Value

ACCEPTANCE FOR VALUE. Note: Acceptance for value is the key to becoming the holder in due course of any negotiable instrument, including your birth certificate. Here, the term “acceptance” refers to the recipient/acceptor and the item accepted (such as one’s birth certificate); “value” refers to that which is given by, or flows back from, the recipient of the item in exchange. The term “value,” as employed in the

UCC, is a highly significant term and comprehension of the Redemption Process requires full understanding of it.
This bubble is one of the bigger ones and I will not be able to cover it much here. Basically it boils down 
to your right to accept the charges they bring against you. This removes any conflict or controversy 
and means the courts should not be involved. You then have them place the charge against your account 
that they hold.

“Surprise, you are the owner!” So you take the bill that she presented to you and because you are the owner, 
you write on it “Accepted for Value, apply to my (the owners) account”. 
Then you sign it. They bill has been settled, it has completed due course and the person who 
initially presented it, has nothing to complain about, after all they were presenting it for you and to you. 

That is essentially the Accepted for Value route, although I strongly suggest you do extensive research 
before trying it. I believe you have to actually redeem your straw man in order for it to work properly; 
otherwise you are not in the owner position.

Warrants and Affidavits

When an Officer of the law tries to serve a warrant, you have the right to see the supporting affidavit 
and that without one, and the warrant is unlawful? You can also use that Affidavit as a foundation 
of your defense if you need to. Is all the information correct? Was it properly sworn and attested to? 
Don’t ever be happy just seeing the warrant; often times they try to play fast and loose and if you catch 
them in it, the process can be cancelled.

Peace Officers and Law Enforcement Officer's

Hello Police Officer.
“Are you a Peace Officer?”
“Yes, I am”
“Have you observed me breach the Peace?”
“No...”
“I hereby exercise my Common Law right to refuse intercourse with a 
Peace Office who has not observed me breach the Peace. Have a good day.”

You have the right to refuse intercourse with a Peace Officer who has not observed you breach the Peace. 
You have to get them to admit they are a Peace Officer first, but if you ask they are obliged to inform 
you of the truth, unless they are undercover, of course. Under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, they 
also have the duty to instruct you of your right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. 

That right exists even if you haven’t been arrested.
Some will try telling you they are ‘Law Enforcement’ Officers. If they say that, ask to see a Court Order 
with your name on it that they are enforcing. Without that order, what exactly are they enforcing? 
If they try saying they are enforcing a statute, ask what evidence they have that you are a member of 
the society being governed. If you ask enough difficult questions in a respectful and assertive way, 
they will not want to mess with you. Be nice to them. They are Officers of the Court and you do not want 
a charge of dishonouring them leveled against you. This does not mean you can’t exercise your rights.
If you are traveling on the road and they ask to see your Driver’s License, you are not obliged to show them. 
You will get a ticket, but that is easy enough to defeat. The reason you do not want to show them your 
license is because the moment the see it, the will no longer be acting as a lawful Peace Officer, 
they will be empowered to act as a Law Enforcement Officer and they can and will pull you out of the 
car and arrest you, especially if you have been questioning their authority. Until they see that 
Instrument however, they must act cautiously, for you may be someone who knows their rights and is 
merely exercising them. You might be a Sharpe-Prick in your own right.

Print this card and hand it to Police officer

Statement for Police Officer: If I am under arrest or being detained, please tell me so. 
If I am free to go, please tell me so. If I am under arrest, please tell me why. 
I want to exercise all my legal rights including my right to silence and my right to speak to a 
lawyer before I say anything to you. Until I speak to a lawyer, I will not willingly cooperate 
with any request you make, unless you command me and explain to me why. 
Thank you for respecting my rights.

POLICE ARREST: Silence is Golden

If you are stopped by police, give them the top part of this card or read it out. 
If you are in a bar, a cinema, or if they say you broke the law, give your name, address, and birth date. 
If driving, show your license. Then, do not say anything until you talk to a lawyer. 
If they command you to do something, politely ask why, and then do it silently.

My Rights:
 
1- I can refuse to talk to the police or answer their questions.
2- I can insist on my right to speak with a lawyer as quickly as possible.
3- I can ask a police officer to tell me his name or badge number. I can get help from a lawyer even if I can't afford to pay.
4- Before the police search my house, my car, my belongings or my body, I can insist that they show me a search warrant, or explain clearly why they are searching me and what they are looking for.
5- I can leave unless I am being arrested or detained.
6- I can insist that I be searched by someone of the same sex.
7- I can leave unless I am being arrested or detained

They use tricks to gain authority over you. If when they stop you, they tell you to open your window and 
you do it, they have seized authority. Before that can happen, if you get stopped, open the window first, 
try to foresee what the Officer will ask for and do it before he can ask. 
Before he asks you for your Identification, turn the tables and ask him for his.

Contracts and Agreements

CONTRACT. An agreement between two or more persons which creates an obligation to do or not to do a
particular thing. Its essentials are competent parties, subject matter, a legal consideration, mutuality of
agreement, and mutuality of obligation. Black’s 5th ed.

All contracts, whether express or implied, are subject to the universal essentials of contract law, 
pertaining to the fundamentals of the interaction between the parties. 
These fundamentals are well codified in many places.

A contract is an agreement to do or not to do a certain thing.
Essential elements of contract
It is essential to the existence of a contract that there should be:
1. Parties capable of contracting;
2. Their consent;
3. Lawful object; and,
4. A sufficient cause or consideration.
Who may contract
All persons are capable of contracting, except minors, persons of unsound mind, and persons deprived of civil rights.
Essentials of consent
The consent of the parties to a contract must be:
1. Free;
2. Mutual; and,
3. Communicated by each to the other.
An apparent consent is not real or free when obtained through:
1. Duress;
2. Menace;
3. Fraud;
4. Undue influence; or
5. Mistake.
When contract wholly void
Where a contract has but a single object, and such object is unlawful, whether in whole or in part, or wholly impossible of performance, or so vaguely expressed as to be wholly unascertainable, the entire contract is void.
Effect of its illegality
If any part of single consideration for one or more objects, or of several considerations for a single object, is unlawful, the entire contract is void.
Express contract, what
An express contract is one, the terms of which are stated in words.
Implied contract, what
An implied contract is one, the existence and terms of which are manifested by conduct.
Impossible or unlawful conditions void
A condition in a contract, the fulfillment of which is impossible or unlawful, within the meaning of the article on the object of contracts, or which is repugnant to the nature of the interest created by the contract, is void. Contracts, how to be interpreted
A contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.
Certain contracts unlawful
All contracts which have for their object, directly or indirectly, to exempt anyone from responsibility for his own fraud, or willful injury to the person or property of another, or violation of law, whether willful or negligent, are against the policy of the law.
Fraudulent deceit
One who willfully deceives another with intent to induce him to alter his position to his injury or risk, is liable for any damage which he thereby suffers.

The PPSA
The PPSA is the Private Property Security Act and it is likely some of the driest and most boring reading you will ever come across. It is dryer than a Sahara Desert travel guide. It is designed to make you fall asleep before you understand what it says. Just like Dorothy and the Poppy fields, this Act has within it the power to free you from those who would interact with you under conditions of fraud or misrepresentation. If you can make it to the end, you will find this section:

this Act has more power then just about anything else out there. Any conflict between this Act and any other Act and this one prevails.

Section Scope of Act: security interests
2 (1) Subject to section 4, this Act applies
(a) to every transaction that in substance creates a security interest, without regard to its form and without regard to the person who has title to the collateral, and
(b) without limiting paragraph (a), to a chattel mortgage, a conditional sale, a floating charge, a pledge, a trust indenture, a trust receipt, an assignment, a consignment, a lease, a trust, and a transfer of chattel paper if they secure payment or performance of an obligation.

What’s a ‘security interest’ we must ask. It states:
"security interest" means
(a) an interest in goods, chattel paper, a security, a document of title, an instrument, money or an intangible that secures payment or performance of an obligation, but does not include the interest of a seller who has shipped goods to a buyer under a negotiable bill of lading or its equivalent to the order of the seller or to the order of an agent of the seller, unless the parties have otherwise evidenced an intention to create or provide for a security interest in the goods, and
(b) the interest of
(i) a transferee arising from the transfer of an account or a transfer of chattel paper,
(ii) a person who delivers goods to another person under a commercial consignment, and
(iii) a lessor under a lease for a term of more than one year,
whether or not the interest secures payment or performance of an obligation;

"intangible" means
(a) personal property, but does not include goods, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument, money or a security, and
(b) a licence;

"instrument" means
(a) a bill of exchange, note or cheque within the meaning of the Bills of Exchange Act (Canada),

(b) any other writing that evidences a right to payment of money and is of a type that in the ordinary course of business is transferred by delivery with any necessary endorsement or assignment, or
(c) a letter of credit or an advice of credit if the letter of credit or advice of credit states on it that it must be surrendered on claiming payment under it,
but does not include
(d) chattel paper, a document of title or a security, or
(e) a bond, debenture or similar document evidencing an obligation secured, in whole or in part, by a mortgage of an interest in land unless the interest being mortgaged is, itself, a mortgage of land;

You will also find this:
"value" means any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, and includes an antecedent debt or liability.

Your greatest intangible asset your identity or your name? Yes friends, your name is an intangible security and you have the utmost interest in it under Natural, Commercial and Common Law. Now why would this be so important?

PPSA’s state:

"Except in so far as they are inconsistent with the express provisions of this Act, the principles 
of law and equity, including the law merchant, the law relating to capacity to contract, principal and agent, 
estoppel, fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake and other validating or invalidating rules of 
law, shall supplement this Act and shall continue to apply."

Put it all together and what have you got?
1. Your name is an intangible security interest.
2. The PPSA covers all transactions concerning security interests.
3. When someone ask for your name, that is a transaction under the PPSA.
4. That transaction is invalidated by any fraud, misrepresentation, duress, coercion, mistake and other
validating or invalidating rules of law,
5. You can become the secured creditor against your ‘person’ so any debt they try to collect from that
‘person’ they have to make sure you get paid first.
6. If you create an antecedent debt with the government and when they try to point out that you owe them
money, you can point out they owed you first and to apply that debit they are claiming to your credit.
7. Any Instrument creating a duty to act or pay is a security interest. Claims can meet this definition.

The PPSA is likely one of the most important statutes for anyone desiring their freedom to understand. 
It allows you to use commercial instruments when dealing with the government and evens the playing field, 
so to speak. It is a very dry and difficult statute to get your head around, and I bet they likely 
did that on purpose. Can’t have the minions realizing the rules of the game, now can we?

Antecedent Debts

Antecedent means ‘previously existing’. If you can understand this concept, you can create an antecedent debt quite lawfully and although you might never collect on it, when the government tries collecting from you, you can defeat them by pointing out the antecedent debt. (Yes I owe you $10,000. But you have owed me $1,000,000 for 3 years. Take the $10,000 off the $1,000,000 you owe me and see you next year!)
How to create an antecedent debt lawfully is the same way you would create any claim of debt. You present them with a bill charging them for services rendered. The services you charge them for is the use of your straw man for the last X years or for the fraud they have perpetrated, or their misrepresentation.

Child of God
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms states right at the beginning, “Canada is a nation founded upon the belief in the supremacy of God and the rule of law.”
This tells us that there is a hierarchy, and God is at the very top. This is good and as it should be. Now ask the killer question;

WHO IS NUMBER 2 IN THAT HIERARCHY?

What if I told you that you have the legal right to claim that number two position and that if you did, no one would have authority over you, except God. Would you believe me? If you do claim your status as a Child of God, who has the right to say it isn’t so? Who will dispute it? The following document is what you would use to claim your status.
WARNING: do not take this step unless you truly believe in God and that you are in fact a Child of God. If you get caught as an imposter the punishment can be very large. Not just from the Judiciary, but from God too. A Child of God enjoys Grace and acts with honour and the moment you start to act contrary to what is acceptable Child of God behaviour, you will be ejected from the ‘party’ and your claim will be lost.

Constructive Notice of Child of God Status

Whereas Canada is a nation founded upon the belief in the principles of the supremacy of God and the rule of law, and,
Whereas the above sentence defines a hierarchy, with God at the top, and,
Whereas the number two position in that hierarchy is not claimed by anyone, and,
Whereas the governments of this nation seem to rely on deception to gain the power to govern, and,
Whereas I am desirous of living my life as a 'Child of God, and,
Whereas the only powers able to claim any authority over a 'Child of God' is God, and,
Whereas neither the government, nor it's agents nor it's representatives or employees are God, or above God, and,
Whereas by legally claiming the number two position in the above-mentioned hierarchy, I occupy a position above all governments and their agents and employees and representatives,
Be it known to any and all, that on this date, ___________,
I, _______________________, a free human being, do hereby lawfully claim the
status of a 'Child of God'.

Any human being who wishes to claim any authority over me must first prove they exist above God; they are God; they are between God and I; or they have a document upon the face of which can be found the verifiable signature of God granting them authority over me.
Failure to first do one of the above-mentioned things means all claims to authority is abandoned or is unlawful.
Attempting to exercise any authority over me without first fulfilling one of the four above mentioned requirements are an unlawful acts of fraud and/or extortion.

Violation Tickets and the Bills of Exchange Act

TICK, contracts. Credit; as, if a servant usually buys for the master upon tick, and the servant buys 
something without the master's order, yet, if the master were trusted by the trader, he is liable.

Have you ever wondered why when you get a tick-et, they give you a copy and not the original? Have you ever wondered why if you pay the fine or ticket, there is still a conviction registered against your name? Ever felt them tickets were something stinky and sneaky? Tickets are actually Bills of Exchange and the entire ticketing process is the Notarial protest in a nutshell!
You are about to learn something exciting; when a tick-et is presented, you have the right and even the duty to take the original ticket and negotiate a payment within three days. If you do this, the Officer cannot give you the defendant’s copy and there will likely not be a conviction registered against our name. If they try to stop you from taking the original, they are agreeing to pay it for you!
Let’s look at what is happening now. An Officer will pull you over and will issue you a tick-et. You sign it, (often with his thumb still on the ticket) give it back to him, he gives you a copy. That’s the process. What would happen if you tried to take the original? Would he let you? This is what Freddie Freepickle thinks; you have a right to take the original ticket and if he stops you, the ticket is dead, or discharged for he is not duly presenting it. Not only do you have a right to take the original ticket, you have a duty and the second copy is really evidence that you failed to accept the first! Ask yourself, and him, what right does he have to deny you the original yet impose a copy? Hmm?? A copy can only be imposed once the original has APPARENTLY been dishonoured.
Let’s use the Bills of Exchange Act to examine what is really happening. The first question we must ask is: Is a Violation Ticket a bill of exchange? The definition of bill of exchange, from the BOEA is as follows:

(1) A bill of exchange is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to bearer.

Certainly would appear that a Violation Ticket matches that definition. If it is a bill, then when they are giving it to you, they are presenting it. They can prove they presented it too; after all, you have signed it, it must have been in your possession for some period of time, right?
Look at this section:
(1) The acceptance of a bill is the signification by the drawee of his assent to the order of the drawer. 
(1) An acceptance is invalid unless it complies with the following conditions:
(a) it must be written on the bill and be signed by the drawee; and
(2) The mere signature of the drawee written on the bill without additional words is a sufficient acceptance.

In the Act, a drawer is the one who creates the bill; the drawee is the one the bill is presented to. Imagine a waitress and a customer. The waitress is the drawer and the customer is the drawee. So they get you to sign it and thus accept it, but then they get it back from you immediately without you getting a receipt. That brings in this section:
They are the drawer of the bill, they have proof you accepted the bill, then failed to pay for it and returned the unpaid bill to them. Obviously you have dishonoured their bill!
The following are key sections of the Bills of Exchange Act.

A protest of any bill or note within Canada, and any copy thereof as copied by the notary or justice of the peace, is, in any action, evidence of presentation and dishonour, and also of service of notice of the presentation and dishonour as stated in the protest
Where a bill or note, presented for acceptance, or payable outside Canada, is protested for non-acceptance or non-payment, a notarial copy of the protest and of the notice of dishonour, and a notarial certificate of the service of the notice, shall be received in all courts as evidence of the protest, notice and service or copy.

(1) An acceptance is invalid unless it complies with the following conditions:
(a) it must be written on the bill and be signed by the drawee; and
(b) it must not express that the drawee will perform his promise by any other means than the payment of money.

(2) The mere signature of the drawee written on the bill without additional words is a sufficient acceptance.

(1) As between immediate parties and as regards a remote party, other than a holder in due course, the delivery of a bill
(a) in order to be effectual must be made either by or under the authority of the party drawing, accepting or endorsing, as the case may be; or
(b) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill.
2) Where the bill is in the hands of a holder in due course, a valid delivery of the bill by all parties prior to him, so as to make them liable to him, is conclusively presumed.

Where a bill is no longer in the possession of a party who has signed it as drawer, acceptor or endorser, a valid and unconditional delivery by him is presumed until the contrary is proved.

(1) Notice of dishonour may be given
(a) as soon as the bill is dishonoured;
(b) to the party to whom notice is required to be given or to his agent in that behalf;
(c) by an agent either in his own name or in the name of any party entitled to give notice, whether that party is his principal or not; or
(d) in writing or by personal communication and in any terms that identify the bill and intimate that the bill has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment.

In point of form, the return of a dishonoured bill to the drawer or endorser are a sufficient notice of dishonour, and a written notice need not be signed.

No person is liable as drawer, endorser or acceptor of a bill who has not signed it as such, but when a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor, he thereby incurs the liabilities of an endorser to a holder in due course and is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting endorsers.

Imagine you are in the restaurant and the waitress presents you with a bill and when you try to pick it up to pay it, she gets mad and tells you that in this restaurant, customers are supposed to reject the bill and accept a mere copy of the unpaid and signed bill so a bouncer can then beat them up. You say, “I don’t want to be beat up, I want to look at this bill and see what I owe so I can pay it.” If at that point she takes the bill back without even allowing you to look at it, can she claim you refused to pay it and therefore send in the bouncers? No she can’t. They are essentially hood winking us to get us to dishonour their bills. That is why they can put a conviction next to your name. They never said it was a conviction for whatever the offence was did they? No they didn’t. It could easily be a conviction for the dishonour of the bill!
Why do they do what they do? Society needed a way to regulate and control its member’s actions yet only had and have lawful means at their disposal. The days of the whip and dunking bucket are thankfully over. One of the means available is to present them with a bill or commercial instrument, which already exists under commercial, or common law if they transgress. The problem is that if the bill is accepted and the fine paid, there has only been a lawful transaction and no conviction can possibly result. It was merely the fulfillment of a contract. They have therefore developed a system that allows them to use a lawful instrument and still create a conviction through dishonour. Unfortunately for them, they are dragging you into dishonour, and the very nature of honour demands that one avoid causing any dishonour.
So with this knowledge, what good can we do with it? How do we use this knowledge to stop going into dishonour with the bills when they are purportedly presented?

First when dealing with the Issuer, ask them these questions:
1. Is that a Bill under The Bills of Exchange Act? (In order for a bill to have validity, the drawer has to have the authority and knowledge to create it. If they say they don’t know, they are admitting a lack of knowledge)
2. Are you giving me a Ticket? (When he says yes, you have the right to take the ticket, not a copy of a ticket. If he gets mad when you take the original, just tell him “You told me you were giving me a ticket, not a copy of a ticket!”)
3. Am I dishonoring your presentment if I sign this and return the original?
4. Are you DEMANDING I return the original bill prior to being able to honour it?
5. Will you give me a receipt for the original before I return it to you? ( a receipt is not a copy of it)

Try to do the following actions:
1. Make him properly present the bill. That means in your control and possession. If he has not let go of the ticket, he has not properly presented or served it. Do not try to remove or grab; lay your hands out flat and make him deposit his book or the ticket in your hands.
2. Remove the original before he can stop you. At the very least rip the ticket at the top so you can point to that rip in court as evidence of you trying to accept it.
3. The goal is for him to demand you return that ticket. The moment he does, he has rescinded the presentation and the bill is dead or discharged. If someone does want to collect for it, it will have to come out of his pocket! (You are demanding I return this to you without first paying it? You have a gun and would threaten to harm or arrest me for accepting this bill? Ok.... But now you can’t lawfully give me a blue copy, because that copy evidences I was not willing to accept the original.)
4. Educate the Officer. I have spoken with a few of them, they were all receptive, found the information interesting and one just yesterday decided not to issue me a ticket until he could ask his superiors about it. I was happy to leave him my address and invited him to issue bills or tickets to me anytime, as I had a few ways to deal with them as well. The basic premise, that a copy cannot be imposed unless an original was offered and rejected is a hard one to dispute; it is fundamental in law and goes to the best evidence rule. They also acknowledged that in order for a signature to be collected, the bill must be in my possession, and that the signature could in fact be evidence of just such a thing.

ACCEPTANCE OF A BILL OF EXCHANGE. In mercantile law. The act by which the person on whom
a bill of exchange is drawn (called the “drawee”) assents to the request of the drawer to pay it, or, in
other words, engages, or makes himself liable to pay it when due. It may be by parol or in writing, and
either general or special, absolute or unconditional; and it may be impliedly, as well as expressly, given.
But the usual and regular mode of acceptance is by the drawee’s writing across the face of the bill the st
word “acceptance,” and subscribing his name; after which he is termed the acceptor. Black’s 1 . See banker’s acceptance, bill of exchange, and sight draft.

FACT: A violation Ticket is a bill of exchange according to the Bills of Exchange Act. (Section 16(1) BEA) 
FACT: A bill returned to the issuer by you with merely a signature on it is evidence of a dishonoured bill.
(Sec 98 BEA)
FACT: A copy of a dishonoured bill is evidence that the bill was presented, served and dishonoured. (Section 10 BEA)
FACT: The reason they impose the copy on you is because you failed to take the original! You can take the original, not a mere copy.
FACT: If the officer tries to stop you from taking the original, HE IS DISCHARGING THE BILL FOR YOU AND ENDS UP BEING LIABLE! (Sec 84 BEA.)
FACT: You have three days grace to honour the bill (original) once presented to you. (Sec 41 BEA)
FACT: If you sign a bill, it is assumed that you are a party to that bill and are liable for it. (Sec 35 (2) BEA)
FACT: You can accept the bill up to two days after it has been duly presented. (Sec 79(1) BEA)
FACT: You do not have to sign the ticket unless you intend to give it back to the officer dishonoured.
FACT: If the officer presenting the bill is incapable of accepting payment when offered, the bill is considered invalid.

Now lets look on the back of the tickets.
Back of the Tickets:
On the back of the Tickets they tell you that you have three choices; ignore, pay or dispute. If you choose to pay, you are agreeing with them that you are guilty and a conviction is entered against your name. If you ignore, it’s the same thing, you are deemed to have accepted the bill and you have to pay. The third option is to
choose to dispute and this is where they really trick you. If you accept this option, you are willfully stepping into dishonour. You have not exercised your right to discuss or negotiate and are jumping right into the dispute. Bear in mind, that if you engage in that option, there will be two parties before the court, with only one wishing to dispute. You have lost honour merely by WISHING FOR DISPUTE. You have abandoned the rule of Law and there really is no sense going to court, for you have essentially already lost. What you want to do is extend an offer to discuss and have them reject that offer. They are then the ones ‘wishing for dispute’ and thus are in dishonour. Realize that they are trying to create an adversarial relationship. They are your foe and antagonist. Lets say someone tried to get you to consent to fight and then said “You have to fight me and the first thing you have to do is either bang your head against the wall or kick the curb.” Why let your adversary dictate the way you will fight them? Clearly they will try to get you to do something that is in their interest and not yours. Wishing dispute is one of the stupidest things anyone can do. Make them state that they wish dispute or force them to discuss it with you. The Officer who issued the ticket will not like that. Defending in court he or she will get paid overtime; dealing with a Conditional Acceptance they will not. Plus, if they do not deal with it, they ends up DISHONOURING THEIR OWN BILL and thus ends up having to pay it themselves.
